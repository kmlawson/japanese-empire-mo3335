# Seminars

Full references to the readings below can be found in the following section ordered by last name of the author. For each week. Please read all of the primary source reading, all of the secondary reading, and please consider reading one of the further readings. 

Abbreviations for readings:

* GORDON: Andrew Gordon *A Modern History of Japan: From Tokugawa Times to the Present*
* SOURCES: *Sources of Japanese Tradition: Volume 2, 1600 to 2000* [Ebook](http://st-andrews.eblib.com/patron/FullRecord.aspx?p=908716)
* MASON: Mason, Michele, and Helen Lee, eds. *Reading Colonial Japan: Text, Context, and Critique* [Ebook](http://library.st-andrews.ac.uk/record=b2201902~S5)

## Week 1 - Introductions

If you have some time before the semester begins, I would strongly recommend that you read some of the chapters of the following survey textbook. I suggest you pick up your own copy as it is a nice text to turn to for reference, or you can always make use of one of our library copies:
 
Andrew Gordon *A Modern History of Japan: From Tokugawa Times To The Present*

There is a copy in the library, but an ebook is not available.

There are several different editions, along with “international” and non-international (US) versions of this book. While the editions have improved over the years and now include a new chapter on Japan’s most recent times, feel free to use any edition since we are primarily using it as a background reference work to help cover the domestic history of Japan while we focus on its empire. You may find cheap copies of older editions and our library doesn't have the latest version, anyways. 

Please read closely the chapters of this book which cover the period from the end of the Tokugawa age, through the early postwar period, up to 1952. In the fourth edition of the book, this includes chapters 5 ("The Samurai Revolution") through chapter 13 ("Occupied Japan: New Departures and Durable Structures") pp60-252. 

The reason why this background reading is important is that this module is not a survey history of modern Japanese history, but you will get most out of the module's study of Japanese imperialism if you can build on a foundation of familiarity with the course of modern Japanese history, which a textbook like this provides.

**Preparation:**

* Choosing one of the two long essay ideas you brought to class from last week, spend an hour "blitz" researching your topic some time this week: who has written about it? What kinds of sources do they use? What kinds of arguments have historians made, write down at least a dozen bullet points or a paragraph or two for discussion. This exercise is to help you start thinking about the broad topic for your long essay. Remember, the short essay is due sooner than you think.
* If you are struggling with ideas for topics, go through the primary source suggestions at the end of this handbook and choose one source to browse through and think of possible ideas for it.
* For many, the topics here are unfamiliar. When you run into unfamiliar territory review the survey text by Gordon, or get in the habit of looking up names, places, or people you are unfamiliar with. Note them down if they pop up and bring them up in class - you may not be the only one!
* Review the page load of readings for the weeks ahead, start planning ahead to make time for your long essay research and writing. Take advantage of weeks with a lighter load to schedule time for the long essay. Think about "time boxing" your reading - fixing in advance the hours you will dedicate to your reading and working within those limits to allow other time for the module on your long essay research, presentation, and other preparation.  
* Try to commit to memory the basic, mostly political, events in the "Chronology" section of this student handbook, for the years up to 1920 (for this week). Note down one or two of these events that you know little or nothing about that you think might be interesting and look them up on Wikipedia.

**Overview:**

* This period, from the early 1870s, until about 1920, represents a huge transformation for Japan, going from a relatively inward looking archipelago to a modern nation with colonial rule over places such as Okinawa, Karafuto (Sakhalin), Taiwan and Korea. It is a period which includes Japan's victory over the Qing dynasty in the first Sino-Japanese War, its inclusion among the imperial powers who intervened in the Qing's Boxer Rebellion, and its triumphant victory in the Russo-Japanese War 1904-5 that sealed its hegemony on the Korean peninsula and established its influence in Manchuria. It also includes World War I, in which Japan fought with the Allies, took over German interests in the Pacific and Shandong, and subjected China to its 21 Demands.
* Our primary sources this week give you several Japanese perspectives on the international environment they face, from Fukuzawa's contemplations of civilisation and Japan's relationship with the West, to the growing frustrations of Tokutomi and Konoe about Japan's place in a world of Western empires. We will discuss and compare these perspectives.
* The MIT exhibits have wonderful sources and we will discuss and analyse a few of those which you have found particularly interesting. Note that the MIT exhibits have an introductory essay but the bulk of the visual material for each exhibit is accessible from the menus at the top: don't miss out on the visual narrative and additional images for each.
* Between Gordon and Beasley, we now should have a basic skeleton of the major events in Japanese imperialism, we will review these. 
* We will ask ourselves what commonalities and differences we see so far between Japan as a coloniser and those of other western empires at this time.
* Any time left over we will use to discuss topics for the long essay and your overviews

**Questions to Think About:**

1. For Japanese leaders at the time what is the relationship between becoming a modern nation and possessing an empire? 
2. What tensions and contradictions are to be found among some of the Japanese figures whose works we have been reading?
3. What are some of the patterns to be found in the image sources of the Visualizing Cultures? How do the introductory essays in the collections use these sources to make arguments?

**Ideas for Long Essay Themes**

* Note: In this section I will put general themes to consider for long essays, but keep in mind that you are by no means limited to them and each of theme contain a full range of more appropriately narrow questions and arguments you might pursue within them.
* There are many sources in non-Japanese languages that will allow you to examine the way Japan's colonization was portrayed abroad, focusing in on one aspect or example of this and making an argument is one possibility for a long essay. Also consider going through the list of further readings in this handbook for the rest of the semester for more ideas of things that are written about.
* Depictions of Japan in some international source or sources, or by Japan of world order in works written by Japanese in English (or another language you know)?
* Aspects of Meiji period transitions within Japan
* Issues of cultural contact between Japan and its neighbors in this period
* Responses of Chinese, Korean, or already colonized peoples to Japan in this period
* Further exploring the visualizations of Japanese imperialism

**Preparation:**

* As you consider your long essay topic, consider browsing primary sources related to Japanese Empire available at this website: 
    * [Grassroots Operations of the Japanese Empire](https://www.japaneseempire.info/)
* Explore primary sources related to Korea and Taiwan:
    * [Taiwan Primary Sources](https://taiwanprimarysources.com/)
    * [Primary Sources: History of Taiwan](https://www.froginawell.net/frog/sources/primary-sources-history-of-taiwan/)
    * [Primary Sources: Modern Korean History](https://www.froginawell.net/frog/sources/primary-sources-modern-korean-history/)

* Examine a map of the Korean peninsula and of the island of Taiwan. Familiarise yourself with the location of the major cities.
* Robinson will give you the general background on the history of colonial Korea. You can use this chapter and the broader book to help you with the Korean context
* Tierney is not all an easy read, make sure you understand what you are reading.
* Look up Nitobe Inazo and read a little about him. Some of you may be interested in exploring his key role in popularising the idea of "Bushido"
* Atkins and Tierney will form an important part of the discussion, as will the "Demon Bird" and the Nitobe readings.

\pagebreak

**Overview:**

* One way we might have examined the history of colonial territories under Japanese control is to examine the chronology of events in each place. We are taking another approach, one that is more thematic. Our readings today step back from the political events to the cultural realm and also the ways in which the Japanese empire attempted to form and change the peoples and places it colonised. In particular, we will see how the world of folklore, cultural artefacts, and the field of anthropology are key to understanding other ways that power figure into the relationship between coloniser and colonised.
* We will take a closer look at the Nitobe Inazo reading and discuss the ways that Japan is described as a colonial power and presented to a western audience, with care taken to the rhetoric and language used as well as the selection of material chosen for presentation.
* We will set aside some time in class to talk about how your topics for the long essay.

**Questions to Think About:**

1. What are some of the ways that knowledge about the colonised peoples were deployed in the Japanese empire?
2. In the period focused on here, what were the primary goals for the Japanese colonisers in attempting to form the peoples under its rule?

**Ideas for Long Essay Themes**

* There is a much more rich literature on ethnography and empire (not limited to East Asia either) and many other possible sources for anthropologists in East Asia to explore these questions of knowing the author. The even richer and broader literature on orientalism offer another way to look at both Japan's use of knowledge in its domination of its neighbours but also of European empires simultaneously jockeying for power in the region.
* Assimilation policies across multiple empires is a fascinating area that opens lots of possible topics that take a comparative approach
* The "Annual Report on Reforms and Progress in Chosen" collection published in several volumes available online through Internet Archive. These are an example of some of the English language primary sources related to Japanese depictions of its colony.
* Travellers to Japan at around this period are an interesting way to explore how a rapidly modernizing and growing empire are depicted. Isabella Bird is one interesting figure, and there are many other works written in English by travellers to Japan's first colonies that you can explore both for their (very often highly racist) depiction of the Japanese and their approach to empire, or Japan's imperial subjects in Korea and Taiwan etc.
* Our text by Nitobe this time was only one of many such texts, exploring others or a pattern within multiple of them is another area.
* Kim Brandt's piece in the further reading is part of a growing literature (not limited to Japan) which looks at the intersection of art and antiquities related to empire that may give you ideas. 

**Films of Interest:**

* YMCA Baseball Team (YMCA 야구단 2002)

**Preparation:**

* Continue your exploration of topics for the long essay. As soon as you are settled on a topic your most important question is: what primary sources can I use? If you are still struggling to find an interesting topic, spend a few hours with one or two of the primary source collections. Browse journals on East Asian History to see the kind of scope and detail aimed at by academic articles. Is your topic broader than an academic article? Then focus in more.
* Think about the case of Officer Ukuma in Okinawa. What are some of the features of his story that might be common to the experience of other people under Japanese colonial rule that we have been reading about. Is that experience unique to colonial settings? If so, in what ways? If not, then what other settings resemble it?
* Many of the readings for today are filled with ironies: where intentions of the coloniser often lead to very differing outcomes when seen in retrospect. Some of them also suggest that simplistic nationalist narratives that emerge in a postcolonial setting are also problematic. In what ways is this the case?

**Overview:**

* There may be assessed presentations
* We'll start by jumping forward a bit to some of the ways that the unfortunately named idea of "colonial modernity" has been come to mean two things today - one thing in the hands of revisionist Japanese historians and politicians, as well as Korean nationalists who oppose them, and another within the scholarly world
* We'll discussion the concepts of modernity, modernisation, the implicit progressivist narrative in these concepts, and the ways in which these are complicated by their place in a colonial setting.
* Group task: We will set aside time again to ask you to reflect on the prospectus. What did you learn from the process, what advice can you offer your fellow students. Where do you go from here?
* Our MASON readings so far have been literary texts. We will continue to make a lot of use of such fictional works written during or very close to the period. Time permitting we will set aside some time to think about what it means to use literary sources in history. What does it do well which other sources often done? What challenges does it bring as we use them?
* If there is time left over we will discuss what kinds of sources have been used in the secondary readings we have done so far for the course and their strengths and challenges.

**Questions:**

1. What is the difference between modernity and modernisation?
2. According to theorists of colonial modernity, how was it distinct from modernity experienced elsewhere?
3. Apologists for empire have often justified past rule as having had, at the very least, a positive impact on their former colonies in terms of infrastructure and economic development. In what ways does the theory of colonial modernity, and indeed, those who critique the idea, call this into question?

**Ideas for Long Essay Themes**

* This week, perhaps more than any others, offers chances to explore literary sources as a way into the period. There is a growing body of English translations of not only Japanese literature from this period but Korean, Chinese, and Taiwanese literature. Many of these offer settings that give the appearance of a bustling early 20th century modern society, but often with all the distortions and limitations of that apparent modernity that we expect to find in a colonial setting. 
* Despite talking about "modernity" which is a more abstract concept, we have said relatively little of modernization, of economic and technological transformations in the colonies, and the development of infrastructure under colonial rule that was of benefit to the coloniser and its increased extraction of resources from its possessions. This could be explored in an essay through an example or comparison, but when doing so, be aware that this is a field that demands careful consideration of: for whom and who benefits.
* We also see this week that the colonizer - colonized two-sided approach has severe limitations and a long essay can look in more depth at some impact of colonisation on a particular group in metropole or colony. 
* Students interested in urban history might consider exploring a long essay with a topic related to cities in the empire - also the topic of a fourth year module I offer for those who want more readings on this.

**Preparation:**

* You should really be making progress on your long essay topic at this point and have located some primary and secondary sources and begun to think about some potential arguments.
* Think about ways of tying the Kim Sa-ryang piece to our readings in the secondary sources. 
* Look for connections across our readings for this week.

**Overview:**
 
* There may be assessed presentations
* Until the full-scale Sino-Japanese war in the 1930s most of the places we have been looking at were assumed to be permanent parts of the Japanese empire. This was a multi-ethnic empire and the strategies of the Japanese government, colonial officials, settlers, and others for what kind of relationships its constituent communities were to have with each other evolved over time. We will focus our time on trying to unpack these relationships.
* We will do a closer reading in class of some parts of the Kim Sa-ryang story

**Questions:**

1. How do our readings help us understand some of the dynamics of the relationship between the coloniser and the colonised? 
2. The migrations described here exist on a spectrum of coercion. What are some of the differing ways the Japanese state became involved in the migrations described here?
3. How is this relationship complicated, if not completely transformed, in the case of settlers or colonised peoples in the metropole?

**Ideas for Long Essay Themes**

* Migration in the empire is an ideal way in to the deeply transnational possibilities of studying the Japanese empire, and exploring contradictions of identity, of power relationships, and networks. Consider exploring the bibliographies of Uchida, Han, Caprio, and O'Dwyer for some inspiration. Our Kim Sa-ryang piece is only one of many Korean works, for example, now available in English translation which attempt to capture the challenges of minorities in the empire. 
* Uchida's *Brokers of Empire* introduction suggests the rich possibilities of comparative studies of settler colonialism with other empires.
* The idea of "informal empire" has been used as a replacement for an alternative Marxist inspired language of "half-colonialism" as it is still known in China today. This area offers a huge variety of possible case studies, potential comparisons, and questions you might explore.

* Anarchist From Colony (박열 2017)
* City of Sadness (悲情城市 1989)
* Blue Swallow (청연 2005)
* Rikidōzan (역도산 2004)
* The Last Princess (2016 - 덕혜옹주)
* A significant number of Japanese gangster (yakuza) films include characters who are depicted as Korean or Korean-Japanese. Some films makes this an active element of the plot, while others give it merely indirect mention.

**Preparation:**

* As you read, please consider the questions listed below for this week carefully.
* Consider posting one of your reflective posts about a source you have been reading closely for your long essay research.

**Overview:**

* There may be assessed presentations
* We'll talk about your observations and thoughts regarding the Manchukuo film.
* We'll focus our discussion on what makes the story of Japan's Manchurian occupation similar and different from the rest of its imperial history

**Questions:**

1. How did the Manchurian "experiment" differ from Japan's experience of imperialism in Korea or Taiwan? How does it differ from any kind of colonialism found in Western empires?
2. What are some of the differences between the ways Asian unity was imagined by Japanese in the sources we consider? 
3. Compare the Ishiwara Kanji and Ishibashi Tanzan readings. What assumptions do they share, and in what ways do they differ? 

**Ideas for Long Essay Themes**

* Japan's Manchurian project is arguably unique in 20th century history, and yet paradoxically, has many characteristics that invite deep comparisons with many other state building, nationalist, and legitimation projects in many other places, including in Japan's Chinese occupied areas in years to come. An essay might focus in on one of these areas, and if English sources are short, then a comparative study might work well.
* Manchukuo created a crisis for an already crisis ridden League of Nations. There are a range of possibilities for exploring the international context for Manchuria that will have a range of non-Japanese sources
* Manchukuo was not just a site of Japanese occupation, within it many other things were going on. The work of Duara, Norman Smith, and Rana Mitter show this. It was also the crucible of Korean nationalism and resistance that would later play a critical role in the development of North Korea in particular.

**Overview:**

* There may be assessed presentations
* We will discuss the evolution of pan-asianism over time and some of its varieties.
* We'll spend the other roughly half of our session on exploring the idea of Kōminka and discussing what this phase of Japanese empire means in relation to earlier periods.

**Long Essay Topic Ideas**

* Pan-asianism is an entire sub-field to itself now in East Asian studies with a host of works out in the past decade, not least in Japanese but also in English. Comparative studies with other pan-movements, or an essay exploring one particular aspect or argument made by pan-Asianists or looking at its reception or its development are some examples of where to go, as well as essays that look at the manifestation of pan-Asianism in a particular area such as architecture, education, wartime propaganda, etc. Look to the further reading for guidance.
* Kōminka manifested itself somewhat differently in different colonies but also there are interesting possibilities for comparisons between it and assimilation efforts in other empires, or even of minority peoples within nation-states.

**Questions:**

1. What is Kōminka, and what is distinct about it compared to earlier colonial efforts, especially in Taiwan and Korea?
2. What are some of the differences between different conceptions of pan-Asianism, subtle or obvious? Is there evolution over time?

* Make substantive progress on your long essay.

**Questions:**

1. In this week we have shifted our focus, via Diana Lary, to the experience of China in wartime. Ask yourself what are some of the defining differences but also similarities between the experience of conquest in the case of colonies and invasion? 
2. What makes the invasion of China different that some of the other military occupations taking place around the world in the 1930s and 1940s?

**Preparation:**

* Following things chronologically, this would normally where many books or classes on Japanese history would turn to Pearl Harbor, to the war in the Pacific, and the dropping of the atomic bomb on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. These were monumental events in the history of the climatic conflict between the United States and Japan and, domestically, are what stand out the most for the people of Japan and the United States today. However, what is often neglected with this focus, and what had a broader long term impact on the entire history of a region is the massive invasion by Japan in late 1941 of almost all of southeast Asia and the destruction of European colonial power there. This was the last disastrous stage of Japanese imperialism.
* Put your main priority on working on your long essay (half the preparation time at least) which should be well along by now.
* The primary sources this week are long, but you may not only skim the works as needed, but might have the pleasure of reading the entirety of a single longer piece for perhaps the first time this semester. Use this as an opportunity to analyse this source critically and look for patterns and interesting features.
* If you are unfamiliar with it, look up the general history of the Burmese, Indian, and British Malayan colonies to get oriented a bit. 

**Overview:**

* There may be assessed presentations
* Short Lecture and Group Task: We'll spend a good portion of our class today comparing notes with each other (hopefully we will have a good balance of students who read each of the primary sources) on the experience of Japan's "sudden rampage" as one book title calls it, through Southeast Asia.
* Time permitting we'll discuss conscription and colonial soldiering in general, and compare the case of Korean and Taiwanese fighting for Japan with the auxiliaries of Southeast Asia.

**Questions:**

1. How did the "double occupations" of southeast Asia (western colonialism and Japanese occupation) make serve to make Japan's war a particularly complex memory for the peoples of southeast Asia?
2. The period from 1941-1945 is called the "Pacific War" and many of the films, books, and indeed classes about this period are taught as the war between Japan and the United States. Reflect on what goes missing from a narrative of this period as a US-Japanese war.
