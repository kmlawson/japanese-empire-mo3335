### Week 1 - Introductions: Japanese History and the Transitions of the 19th Century

**Reading:** 

* GORDON Ch 4-12 (p48-223, 175 pages) 
    * *What to Look For*: These chapters, from a survey history of modern Japan, will be crucial for you to get the broad historical sweep for the course. Given the thematic emphasis of this course and its focus on empire, much of what is in this reading is the only reading you will have that covers some of the domestic developments in Japanese history and the only time that you will have a strictly chronological overview. If you have never studied East Asian or specifically Japanese history before, I would urge you to read this twice, once at the beginning of the semester, and again during the mid-semester break.
    * I would tackle the reading in two or three sessions and read these pages closely, and take good notes to refer to throughout the semester. How long did it take you to read these 175 pages closely? Make a note of this as your "slow rate" - some texts will need slow reading to fully absorb them well, and others can be read twice as fast as you search for the main arguments, closely read difficult theoretical sections, make note of key case studies and evidence, and skim over sections you think are less relevant. This is the key to managing reading of 150-250 pages a week.

**Preparation:**

* I would urge students to purchase your own copy of Andrew Gordon's *A Modern History of Japan: From Tokugawa Times to the Present*. The most recent edition is best, but any edition will suffice. It serves as a concise and useful survey of Japanese history in general, as opposed to the empire in particular, and therefore will serve as a good reference for grounding yourself in the broader national narrative of the imperial metropole.
* Bring a list of at least three themes or general areas related to the history of Japanese empire that interest you and be prepared to say something about why you find them interesting
* Be ready to share some thoughts on how a module on Japanese empire might differ from a module entitled, for example, 'Modern Japanese History'
* Look the readings in each of the weeks ahead and read the handbook section on assessed fifteen minute text guides. Be prepared to sign up for the week you would like to do an assessed presentation, and two weeks when you are willing to be a text guide. You may change weeks for the assessed presentation in the future, but only if you do so more than 10 days in advance and either a) there is only one person doing an assessed presentation in a given week, or b) you make an arrangement to switch with someone.

**Overview:**

* Our first meeting will talk about the relationship between studying the history of Japan, and the history of Japanese empire. 
* I will offer a short lecture, the only lecture of more than a few minutes you will receive during the semester which will take you on a tour through the course and what we will be covering. 
* Group Exercise: We will evaluate the familiarity we have with the history of East Asia and the studies of empire. You will have an opportunity to share what aspects of this topic you find most interesting and want to learn about. 
* We will discuss the assignments, and particularly emphasise the importance of beginning early and working consistently on your long essay. I will explain what the expectations are and urge you to make good use of this handbook which offers a lot of detailed advice. 
* We will discuss the format of the final examination, and share tips for how to deal with the reading load from week to week. 
* We will discuss the collective notes and how it has helped students in past iterations of this module. 
* Finally, we will also have a chance to get to know each other a bit better.

**Preparation:**

* The Moon and Eskildsen pieces will be discussed in depth, please read them closely
* For many, the topics here are unfamiliar. When you run into unfamiliar territory review the survey text by Gordon, or get in the habit of looking up names, places, or people you are unfamiliar with. Note them down if they pop up and bring them up in class - you may not be the only one!
* Review the page load of readings for the weeks ahead, start planning ahead to make time for your long essay research and writing. Take advantage of weeks with a lighter load to schedule time for the long essay. 
* Start thinking about the broad topic for your long essay. Remember, the short essay (either a prospectus for the long essay or critical review) is due not before long.
* Try to commit to memory the basic, mostly political, events in the "Chronology" section of this student handbook, for the years up to 1920. Note down one or two of these events that you know little or nothing about that you think might be interesting and look them up on Wikipedia.
* The Beasley reading gives you a fairly straightforward political narrative that will add some depth to the survey provided by Gordon in his history of modern Japan

**Overview:**

* This week covers a lot of ground and could easily have been addressed in detail over the course of half a dozen weeks, rather than a single one. This period, from the early 1870s, until about 1920, represents a huge transformation for Japan, going from a relatively inward looking archipelago to a modern nation with colonial rule over places such as Okinawa, Karafuto (Sakhalin), Taiwan and Korea. It is a period which includes Japan's victory over the Qing dynasty in the first Sino-Japanese War, its inclusion among the imperial powers who intervened in the Qing's Boxer Rebellion, and its triumphant victory in the Russo-Japanese War 1904-5 that sealed its hegemony on the Korean peninsula and established its influence in Manchuria. It also includes World War I, in which Japan fought with the Allies, took over German interests in the Pacific and Shandong, and subjected China to its 21 Demands.
* Our primary sources this week give you several Japanese perspectives on the international environment they face, from Fukuzawa's contemplations of civilisation and Japan's relationship with the West, to the growing frustrations of Tokutomi and Konoe about Japan's place in a world of Western empires. We will discuss and compare these perspectives.
* We will spend some time on the arguments of Eskildsen and Moon in particular, which both complicate the narrative in various ways, and introduces new perspectives.
* The MIT exhibits have wonderful sources and we will discuss and analyse a few of those which you have found particularly interesting.
* Between Gordon and Beasley, we now should have a basic skeleton of the major events in Japanese imperialism, we will review these
* We will ask ourselves what commonalities and differences we see so far between Japan as a coloniser and those of other western empires at this time.
* There may be unassessed or assessed presentations
* Any time left over we will use to discuss topics for the long essay

* Look up Nitobe Inazo and read a little about him.
* Atkins and Tierney will form an important part of the discussion, as will the "Demon Bird" and the Nitobe readings.
* You should be working on your first prospectus or critical review.

**Overview:**

* One way we might have examined the history of colonial territories under Japanese control is to examine the chronology of events in each place. We are taking another approach, one that is more thematic. Our readings today step back from the political events to the cultural realm and also the ways in which the Japanese empire attempted to form and change the peoples and places it colonised. In particular, we the world of folklore, cultural artefacts, and the field of anthropology are key. 
* We will take a closer look at the Nitobe Inazo reading and discuss the ways that Japan is described as a colonial power.
* We will set aside some time in class to talk about how your topics for the long essay, and your first prospectus or critical review is coming along. We will discuss this groups and then together.
* There may be unassessed or assessed presentations

**Questions:**

1. What are some of the ways that knowledge about the colonised peoples were deployed in the Japanese empire?
2. In the period focused on here, what were the primary goals for the Japanese colonisers in attempting to form the peoples under its rule?

**Preparation:**

* Think about the case of Officer Ukama. What are some of the features of his story that might be common to others under Japanese colonial rule. Is that experience unique to colonial settings? If so, in what ways? If not, then what other settings resemble it?
* Many of the readings for today are filled with ironies: where intentions of the coloniser often lead to very differing outcomes when seen in retrospect. Some of them also suggest that simplistic nationalist narratives that emerge in a postcolonial setting are also problematic. In what ways is this the case?

**Overview:**

* There may be unassessed or assessed presentations
* We'll start by jumping forward a bit to some of the ways that the unfortunately named idea of "colonial modernity" has been come to mean two things today - one thing in the hands of revisionist Japanese historians and politicians, as well as Korean nationalists who oppose them, and another within the scholarly world
* We'll discussion the concepts of modernity, modernisation, the implicit progressivist narrative in these concepts, and the ways in which these are complicated by their place in a colonial setting.
* Group task: We will set aside time again to ask you to reflect on the prospectus or critical review exercise. What did you learn from the process, what advice can you offer your fellow students. Where do you go from here?
* Our MASON readings so far have been literary texts. We will continue to make a lot of use of such fictional works written during or very close to the period. Time permitting we will set aside some time to think about what it means to use literary sources in history. What does it do well which other sources often done? What challenges does it bring as we use them?
* If there is time left over we will discuss what kinds of sources have been used in the secondary readings we have done so far for the course and their strengths and challenges.

**Questions:**

1. What is the difference between modernity and modernisation?
2. According to theorists of colonial modernity, how was it distinct from modernity experienced elsewhere?
3. Apologists for empire have often justified past rule as having had, at the very least, a positive impact on their former colonies in terms of infrastructure and economic development. In what ways does the theory of colonial modernity, and indeed, those who critique the idea, call this into question?

* The migrations described here exist on a spectrum of coercion. What are some of the differing ways the Japanese state became involved in the migrations described here
* Uchida Jun is the leading historian of Japanese settlers. In her introduction to *Brokers of Empire* (in the further reading) she suggests some of the ways that Japanese settler colonialism can be compared fruitfully with other cases elsewhere. Can you think of what some of these might be and what parallels might exist?
* We will spend some time looking closely at the Kim Sa-ryang piece in light of the secondary sources. 
* Look for connections across our readings for this week.

**Overview:**
 
* There may be unassessed or assessed presentations
* Until the full-scale Sino-Japanese war in the 1930s most of the places we have been looking at were assumed to be permanent parts of the Japanese empire. This was a multi-ethnic empire and the strategies of the Japanese government, colonial officials, settlers, and others for what kind of relationships its constituent communities were to have with eachother evolved over time. We will focus our time on trying to unpack these relationships.
* We will do a closer reading in class of some parts of the Kim Sa-ryang story and the MASON reading. 

**Questions:**

1. How do our readings help us understand some of the dynamics of the relationship between the coloniser and the colonised? 
2. How is this relationship complicated, if not completely transformed, in the case of settlers or colonised peoples in the metropole?

**Films of Interest:**

* City of Sadness (悲情城市 1989)
* Blue Swallow (청연 2005)
* Rikidōzan (역도산 2004)
* A significant number of Japanese gangster (yakuza) films include characters who are depicted as Korean or Korean-Japanese. Some films makes this an active element of the plot, while others give it merely indirect mention.

* The class will dive roughly half way between a focus on the Japanese invasion and state building project in Manchuria, and the other half on Japan's evolving Pan-Asianist ideas.

**Questions:**

1. How did the Manchurian "experiment" differ from Japan's experience of imperialism in Korea or Taiwan? How does it differ from any kind of colonialism found in Western empires?
2. What are some of the differences between the ways Asian unity was imagined by Japanese in the sources we consider? 
3. Compare the Ishiwara Kanji and Ishibashi Tanzan readings. What assumptions do they share, and in what ways do they differ?

**Preparation:**

* I do not expect you to read all of the Brook documents on the Nanjing massacre. Instead, use this opportunity to practice your skimming skills as a historian might in the process of their research. Spending a total of no more than an hour on these documents take some notes on what you find to be patterns in the sources: what kinds of violence, what strategies does the safety committee have in their response, what are patterns, in turn, of the Japanese response to these efforts. 
* Think about the ways the Kawakami propaganda piece resembles the Nitobe Inazo reading we did earlier in the semester. What rhetorical techniques are at work here? 
* You should work to complete your second prospectus or critical review

**Overview:**

* There may be unassessed or assessed presentations
* The Nanjing massacre is the most famous of Japan's atrocities in war, but unfortunately it was only part of one broader pattern of violence in occupied areas under Japanese forces in almost all parts of the empire, especially from 1937-1945. However, it is one pattern. We will try to evaluate some specific features of the Nanjing episode and then ask how it might have differed in scale and severity from some other areas and times.
* We'll spend the other roughly half of our session on exploring the idea of Kōminka and discussing what this phase of Japanese empire means in relation to earlier periods.

**Questions:**

1. Discuss the differences or similarities in the portrayal of the Japanese as urban occupiers in the Documents on the Rape of Nanking with the depiction of the same in Aso's memoir From Shanghai to Shangai
2. What is Kōminka, and what is distinct about it compared to earlier colonial efforts, especially in Taiwan and Korea?

**Preparation:**

* The primary sources this week are long, but you may not only skim the works as needed, but might have the pleasure of reading the entirety of a single longer piece for perhaps the first time this semester. Use this as an opportunity to analyse this source critically and look for patterns and interesting features.
* Consider choosing a chapter from Lebra in the secondary sources to dovetail the primary source. For example, if you read the Ba Maw text, then consider reading the Burma Independence Army chapter in Lebra.
* If you are unfamiliar with it, look up the general history of the Burmese, Indian, and British Malayan colonies to get oriented a bit. 
* You should now really be making progress on your long essay for the course. If you have not, it is really time to get going so that you are well position to make good use of our group writing exercises in the consolidation week next week.

**Overview:**

* There may be unassessed or assessed presentations
* Group Task: We'll spend a good portion of our class today comparing notes with each other (hopefully we will have a good balance of students who read each of the primary sources) on the experience of Japan's "sudden rampage" as one book title calls it, through Southeast Asia.
* Group Task: We will again meet and discuss the experience of working on the second prospectus or critical review, and discuss progress on the long essay. 
* Time permitting we'll discuss conscription and colonial soldiering in general, and compare the case of Korean and Taiwanese fighting for Japan with the auxiliaries of Southeast Asia.

**Questions:**

1. How did the "double occupations" of southeast Asia (western colonialism and Japanese occupation) make serve to make Japan's war a particularly complex memory for the peoples of southeast Asia?
2. The period from 1941-1945 is called the "Pacific War" and many of the films, books, and indeed classes about this period are taught as the war between Japan and the United States. Reflect on what goes missing from a narrative of this period as a US-Japanese war.

**Films of Interest:**

* Three Godless Years (1976 - Tatlong Taong Walang Diyos)
* The Burmese Harp (1956)
* Bose - The Forgotten Hero (2004)

### Week 9 - Long Essay Discussion and Pair Writing

**Preparation**

There is no assigned reading for this session. The time you would otherwise spend reading for our seminar should be dedicated entirely to work on your long essay. Take good advantage of this time.

Please bring your laptop or tablet to class for this session.

By this point in the semester, you should have made good progress on your long essay and composed at least some portion of it. This might be a first attempt at the introduction, an analytical passage articulating some important argument you wish to make, or an anecdote which provides a piece of support for your argument. It is tempting to have only a detailed outline at this point, but there is a very long way between the beautiful structure apparent on an outline and the reality of text on a screen. Please bring some portion of what you have written, no more than a single printed page in length with you. We will proceed as follows:

1. 30m - First we will form small groups, exchange some of the written work we have done so far, read it silently for 10 minutes, and then have a discussion. Each student can discuss some of their challenges in the research so far, ask for help, and give each other general feedback.

2. 25m - We will form pairs and do a 'pair writing' exercise. During this time one student, the 'driver' will write on their long essay. This can be a direct continuation of what they have already written, a new section, or more casual free flowing of ideas about their paper. If you like, you can write a summary of your essay as a whole. If you are behind in your work, you can write an updated 'prospectus' discussing the direction you are hoping to develop the essay. As you do this, your partner, the 'observer' will sit beside you and watch you write, offering occasional feedback, suggestions, or pose questions to you about what you write. If you struggle with a phrase or an idea, your partner should offer you help. 

3. 25m - After a five minute break, we will switch driver/observer to allow the other partner to write. Same as above.

4. 30m - Finally we will re-form as a class and share thoughts on the experience and offer each other concrete suggestions on how to overcome problems faced so far, or where to proceed. Did you learn anything from the style or approach of your partner? Did you get any new ideas from interacting with others either in the groups early on or in the partner writing exercise?

**Preparation:**

* Don't be fooled by the somewhat shorter page count: The Calichman and Najita readings are challenging
* Think about the connections between our many readings on Japanese pan-Asianism and the philosophical and literary theoretical material we have read for this week.
* Last push for the long essay!

**Overview:**

* There may be unassessed or assessed presentations
* Together we will explore the relationship between the Greater East Asia War and Japan's wartime struggle to, well, make sense of its place in the world, in time, and bestow, in the midst of its fight, meaning on the project of empire and nation as a whole. 

**Questions:**

1. What does “overcoming modernity” mean and how did Japanese intellectuals believe it could be accomplished? 
2. How are the debates we have examined here on modernity connected to and distinct from the broader story of Japanese imperialism?
