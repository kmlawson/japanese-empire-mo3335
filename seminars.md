### Week 0 - Introductions: Japanese History and the Transitions of the 19th Century

**Reading:** 

* GORDON Ch 4-12 (p48-223, 175 pages) 
    * *What to Look For*: These chapters, from a survey history of modern Japan, will be crucial for you to get the broad historical sweep for the course. Given the thematic emphasis of this course and its focus on empire, much of what is in this reading is the only reading you will have that covers some of the domestic developments in Japanese history and the only time that you will have a strictly chronological overview. If you have never studied East Asian or specifically Japanese history before, I would urge you to read this twice, once at the beginning of the semester, and again during the mid-semester break.
    * I would tackle the reading in two or three sessions and read these pages closely, and take good notes to refer to throughout the semester. How long did it take you to read these 175 pages closely, taking good notes along the way? Perhaps 8-12 hours? Make a note of this as your "slow rate" - some texts during the semester will require this slow reading to fully absorb them well, and others can be read or skimmed much faster (perhaps 50 pages an hour or more?) as you search for the main arguments, closely read a few of the difficult theoretical sections, make note of key case studies and evidence, and skim over sections you think are less relevant. This is the key to managing reading of 150-250 pages a week while working on your long essay research.

**Preparation:**

* Those of you who joined the course late or for any other reason were not able to attend this first meeting, please still be aware of the need to read the Gordon material during the course of the semester.
* I would urge students to purchase your own copy of Andrew Gordon's *A Modern History of Japan: From Tokugawa Times to the Present*. The most recent edition is best, but any edition will suffice. It serves as a concise and useful survey of Japanese history in general, as opposed to the empire in particular, and therefore will serve as a good reference for grounding yourself in the broader national narrative of the imperial metropole. 
* Bring a list of at least three themes or general areas related to the history of Japanese empire that interest you and be prepared to say something about why you find them interesting
* Be ready to share some thoughts on how a module on Japanese empire might differ from a module entitled, for example, 'Modern Japanese History'
* You will spend a significant portion of time during this semester working on your own original research essay: bring at least 2 ideas of broad areas that interest you for possible research on. They don't need to be limited to Japan as a geographic location but can be a theme, or a kind of source.
* Look at the readings for each of the weeks ahead and read the handbook section on presentations. Be prepared to sign up for the week you would like to do an assessed presentation. This can be done on the module mooodle wiki. You may change weeks for the assessed presentation in the future but only if you make an arrangement to switch with someone and they agree. You do not need to contact me about this change, but it must be indicated on our online class presentation schedule.

**Overview:**

* Our first meeting will talk about the relationship between studying the history of Japan, and the history of Japanese empire. 
* Everything you need to know about the module can be found in this handbook, but we'll use this meeting to discuss some of these features and give you a chance to ask for clarification. We will discuss the assignments, and particularly emphasise the importance of beginning early and working consistently on your long essay. I will explain what the expectations are and urge you to make good use of this handbook which offers a lot of detailed advice. 
* We will discuss the format of the final examination, and share tips for how to deal with the reading load from week to week. 
* We will discuss the collective notes and how it has helped students in past iterations of this module. 
* We will sign up for presentations.
* Finally, we will also have a chance to get to know each other a bit better.

**Preparation:**

* Choosing one of the two long essay ideas you brought to class from last week, spend an hour "blitz" researching your topic: who has written about it? What kinds of sources do they use? What kinds of arguments have historians made, write down at least a dozen bullet points or a paragraph or two for discussion. This exercise is to help you start thinking about the broad topic for your long essay. Remember, the short essay (either a prospectus for the long essay or critical review) is due sooner than you think.
* The primary sources, along with the Moon and Eskildsen pieces will be discussed in depth, please read them closely
* For many, the topics here are unfamiliar. When you run into unfamiliar territory review the survey text by Gordon, or get in the habit of looking up names, places, or people you are unfamiliar with. Note them down if they pop up and bring them up in class - you may not be the only one!
* Review the page load of readings for the weeks ahead, start planning ahead to make time for your long essay research and writing. Take advantage of weeks with a lighter load to schedule time for the long essay. Think about "time boxing" your reading - fixing in advance the hours you will dedicate to your reading and working within those limits to allow other time for the module on your long essay research, presentation, and other preparation.  
* Try to commit to memory the basic, mostly political, events in the "Chronology" section of this student handbook, for the years up to 1920. Note down one or two of these events that you know little or nothing about that you think might be interesting and look them up on Wikipedia.

**Overview:**

* This period, from the early 1870s, until about 1920, represents a huge transformation for Japan, going from a relatively inward looking archipelago to a modern nation with colonial rule over places such as Okinawa, Karafuto (Sakhalin), Taiwan and Korea. It is a period which includes Japan's victory over the Qing dynasty in the first Sino-Japanese War, its inclusion among the imperial powers who intervened in the Qing's Boxer Rebellion, and its triumphant victory in the Russo-Japanese War 1904-5 that sealed its hegemony on the Korean peninsula and established its influence in Manchuria. It also includes World War I, in which Japan fought with the Allies, took over German interests in the Pacific and Shandong, and subjected China to its 21 Demands.
* Our primary sources this week give you several Japanese perspectives on the international environment they face, from Fukuzawa's contemplations of civilisation and Japan's relationship with the West, to the growing frustrations of Tokutomi and Konoe about Japan's place in a world of Western empires. We will discuss and compare these perspectives.
* We will spend some time on the arguments of Eskildsen and Moon in particular, which both complicate the narrative in various ways, and introduces new perspectives.
* The MIT exhibits have wonderful sources and we will discuss and analyse a few of those which you have found particularly interesting.
* Between Gordon and Beasley, we now should have a basic skeleton of the major events in Japanese imperialism, we will review these
* We will ask ourselves what commonalities and differences we see so far between Japan as a coloniser and those of other western empires at this time.
* Any time left over we will use to discuss topics for the long essay and your overviews

**Ideas for Long Essay Themes**

* Note: In this section I will put general themes to consider for long essays, but keep in mind that you are by no means limited to them and each of theme contain a full range of more appropriately narrow questions and arguments you might pursue within them.
* There are many sources in non-Japanese languages that will allow you to examine the way Japan's colonization was portrayed abroad, focusing in on one aspect or example of this and making an argument is one possibility for a long essay
* Depictions of Japan, or by Japan of world order?
* Aspects of Meiji period transitions within Japan
* Issues of cultural contact between Japan and its neighbors in this period
* Responses of Chinese, Korean, or already colonized peoples to Japan in this period
* Further exploring the visualizations of Japanese imperialism

**Preparation:**

* Examine a map of the Korean peninsula and of the island of Taiwan. Familiarise yourself with the location of the major cities.
* Robinson will give you the general background on the history of colonial Korea. You can use this chapter and the broader book to help you with the Korean context
* Tierney is not all an easy read, make sure you understand what you are reading.
* Look up Nitobe Inazo and read a little about him. Some of you may be interested in exploring his key role in popularising the idea of "Bushido"
* Atkins and Tierney will form an important part of the discussion, as will the "Demon Bird" and the Nitobe readings.
* You should be working on your first prospectus or critical review.

**Overview:**

* There may be assessed presentations
* One way we might have examined the history of colonial territories under Japanese control is to examine the chronology of events in each place. We are taking another approach, one that is more thematic. Our readings today step back from the political events to the cultural realm and also the ways in which the Japanese empire attempted to form and change the peoples and places it colonised. In particular, we will see how the world of folklore, cultural artefacts, and the field of anthropology are key to understanding other ways that power figure into the relationship between coloniser and colonised.
* We will take a closer look at the Nitobe Inazo reading and discuss the ways that Japan is described as a colonial power and presented to a western audience, with care taken to the rhetoric and language used as well as the selection of material chosen for presentation.
* We will set aside some time in class to talk about how your topics for the long essay, and your first prospectus or critical review is coming along. We will discuss this groups and then together.
* Abstracts Discussion: I will bring a list of abstracts for conference presentations and published articles. These are (somewhat shorter) examples of what you are aiming for in the prospectus. We will discuss what kinds of information they contain and what makes them stronger or weaker.

**Questions:**

1. What are some of the ways that knowledge about the colonised peoples were deployed in the Japanese empire?
2. In the period focused on here, what were the primary goals for the Japanese colonisers in attempting to form the peoples under its rule?

**Ideas for Long Essay Themes**

* There is a much more rich literature on ethnography and empire, many other possible sources for anthropologists in East Asia to explore these questions of knowing the author. The even richer and broader literature on orientalism offer another way to look at both Japan's use of knowledge in its domination of its neighbours but also of European empires simultaneously jockeying for power in the region.
* Assimilation policies across multiple empires is a fascinating area that opens lots of possible topics that take a comparative approach
* Our text by Nitobe this time was only one of many such texts, exploring others or a pattern within multiple of them is another area.
* Kim Brandt's piece in the further reading is part of a growing literature (not limited to Japan) which looks at the intersection of art and antiquities related to empire that may give you ideas.

**Preparation:**

* SHORT ESSAY DUE - Your first prospectus or a critical review is due. For guidance, think of a longer version of the abstract for a conference or published article, and for the critical review, read some of the book reviews from a journal like the Journal of Asian Studies or Past & Present. 
* Think about the case of Officer Ukama in Okinawa. What are some of the features of his story that might be common to the experience of other people under Japanese colonial rule that we have been reading about. Is that experience unique to colonial settings? If so, in what ways? If not, then what other settings resemble it?
* Many of the readings for today are filled with ironies: where intentions of the coloniser often lead to very differing outcomes when seen in retrospect. Some of them also suggest that simplistic nationalist narratives that emerge in a postcolonial setting are also problematic. In what ways is this the case?

**Overview:**

* There may be assessed presentations
* We'll start by jumping forward a bit to some of the ways that the unfortunately named idea of "colonial modernity" has been come to mean two things today - one thing in the hands of revisionist Japanese historians and politicians, as well as Korean nationalists who oppose them, and another within the scholarly world
* We'll discussion the concepts of modernity, modernisation, the implicit progressivist narrative in these concepts, and the ways in which these are complicated by their place in a colonial setting.
* Group task: We will set aside time again to ask you to reflect on the prospectus or critical review exercise. What did you learn from the process, what advice can you offer your fellow students. Where do you go from here?
* Our MASON readings so far have been literary texts. We will continue to make a lot of use of such fictional works written during or very close to the period. Time permitting we will set aside some time to think about what it means to use literary sources in history. What does it do well which other sources often done? What challenges does it bring as we use them?
* If there is time left over we will discuss what kinds of sources have been used in the secondary readings we have done so far for the course and their strengths and challenges.

**Questions:**

1. What is the difference between modernity and modernisation?
2. According to theorists of colonial modernity, how was it distinct from modernity experienced elsewhere?
3. Apologists for empire have often justified past rule as having had, at the very least, a positive impact on their former colonies in terms of infrastructure and economic development. In what ways does the theory of colonial modernity, and indeed, those who critique the idea, call this into question?

**Ideas for Long Essay Themes**

* This week, perhaps more than any others, offers chances to explore literary sources as a way into the period. There is a growing body of English translations of not only Japanese literature from this period but Korean, Chinese, and Taiwanese literature. Many of these offer settings that give the appearance of a bustling early 20th century modern society, but often with all the distortions and limitations of that apparent modernity that we expect to find in a colonial setting. 
* Despite talking about "modernity" which is a more abstract concept, we have said relatively little of modernization, of economic and technological transformations in the colonies, and the development of infrastructure under colonial rule that was of benefit to the coloniser and its increased extraction of resources from its possessions. This could be explored in an essay through an example or comparison, but when doing so, be aware that this is a field that demands careful consideration of: for whom and who benefits.
* We also see this week that the colonizer - colonized two-sided approach has severe limitations and a long essay can look in more depth at some impact of colonisation on a particular group in metropole or colony. 
* Students interested in urban history might consider exploring a long essay with a topic related to cities in the empire - also the topic of a fourth year module I offer for those who want more readings on this.

**Preparation:**

* Reading is on the heavy side this week while you wait for feedback on your first short essay focus on your reading more this week.
* The migrations described here exist on a spectrum of coercion. What are some of the differing ways the Japanese state became involved in the migrations described here
* Think about ways of tying the Kim Sa-ryang piece to our readings in the secondary sources. 
* Look for connections across our readings for this week.

**Overview:**
 
* There may be assessed presentations
* Until the full-scale Sino-Japanese war in the 1930s most of the places we have been looking at were assumed to be permanent parts of the Japanese empire. This was a multi-ethnic empire and the strategies of the Japanese government, colonial officials, settlers, and others for what kind of relationships its constituent communities were to have with each other evolved over time. We will focus our time on trying to unpack these relationships.
* We will do a closer reading in class of some parts of the Kim Sa-ryang story

**Questions:**

1. How do our readings help us understand some of the dynamics of the relationship between the coloniser and the colonised? 
2. How is this relationship complicated, if not completely transformed, in the case of settlers or colonised peoples in the metropole?

**Ideas for Long Essay Themes**

* Migration in the empire is an ideal way in to the deeply transnational possibilities of studying the Japanese empire, and exploring contradictions of identity, of power relationships, and networks. Consider exploring the bibliographies of Uchida, Han, Caprio, and O'Dwyer for some inspiration. Our Kim Sa-ryang piece is only one of many Korean works, for example, now available in English translation which attempt to capture the challenges of minorities in the empire. 
* Uchida's *Brokers of Empire* introduction suggests the rich possibilities of comparative studies of settler colonialism with other empires.
* The idea of "informal empire" has been used as a replacement for an alternative Marxist inspired language of "half-colonialism" as it is still known in China today. This area offers a huge variety of possible case studies, potential comparisons, and questions you might explore.

**Films of Interest:**

* Blue Swallow (청연 2005)
* Rikidōzan (역도산 2004)
* The Last Princess (2016 - 덕혜옹주)
* A significant number of Japanese gangster (yakuza) films include characters who are depicted as Korean or Korean-Japanese. Some films makes this an active element of the plot, while others give it merely indirect mention.

* How is your progress with your long essay topic coming along? Start thinking about your second prospectus or critical review.
* As you read, please consider the questions listed below for this week carefully.

**Overview:**

* There may be assessed presentations
* We'll talk about your observations and thoughts regarding the Manchukuo film.
* The class will dive roughly half way between a focus on the Japanese invasion and state building project in Manchuria, and the other half on Japan's evolving Pan-Asianist ideas.

**Questions:**

1. How did the Manchurian "experiment" differ from Japan's experience of imperialism in Korea or Taiwan? How does it differ from any kind of colonialism found in Western empires?
2. What are some of the differences between the ways Asian unity was imagined by Japanese in the sources we consider? 
3. Compare the Ishiwara Kanji and Ishibashi Tanzan readings. What assumptions do they share, and in what ways do they differ? 

**Ideas for Long Essay Themes**

* Japan's Manchurian project is arguably unique in 20th century history, and yet paradoxically, has many characteristics that invite deep comparisons with many other state building, nationalist, and legitimation projects in many other places, including in Japan's Chinese occupied areas in years to come. An essay might focus in on one of these areas, and if English sources are short, then a comparative study might work well.
* Pan-asianism is an entire sub-field to itself now in East Asian studies with a host of works out in the past decade, not least in Japanese but also in English. Comparative studies with other pan-movements, or an essay exploring one particular aspect or argument made by pan-Asianists or looking at its reception or its development are some examples of where to go, as well as essays that look at the manifestation of pan-Asianism in a particular area such as architecture, education, wartime propaganda, etc. Look to the further reading for guidance.
* Manchukuo created a crisis for an already crisis ridden League of Nations. There are a range of possibilities for exploring the international context for Manchuria that will have a range of non-Japanese sources
* Manchukuo was not just a site of Japanese occupation, within it many other things were going on. The work of Duara, Norman Smith, and Rana Mitter show this. It was also the crucible of Korean nationalism and resistance that would later play a critical role in the development of North Korea in particular.

### Week 6 - Independent Learning Week

* This is an excellent time to really focus on your research for the long essay and start writing it! Come back having at least written a few paragraphs - even if they are just a stream of ideas and possible directions.
* If you have been falling behind on the reading, this would also be a good time to catch up on this. 
* Consider meeting with some classmates in independent learning week to share notes and discuss preparation for the final examination. Or at least go over your notes so far for the semester and identify where you may need to revisit.
* This is also a great time to go over the general survey history of Japan that we began the semester with (GORDON).

**Preparation:**

* SHORT ESSAY DUE - Your second prospectus or a critical review is due.
* I do not expect you to read all of the Brook documents on the Nanjing massacre. Instead, use this opportunity to practice your skimming skills as a historian might in the process of their research. Spending a total of no more than an hour on these documents take some notes on what you find to be patterns in the sources: what kinds of violence, what strategies does the safety committee have in their response, what are patterns, in turn, of the Japanese response to these efforts. 
* Think about the ways the Kawakami propaganda piece resembles the Nitobe Inazo reading we did earlier in the semester. What rhetorical techniques are at work here? 

**Overview:**

* There may be assessed presentations
* The Nanjing massacre is the most famous of Japan's atrocities in war, but unfortunately it was only part of one broader pattern of violence in occupied areas under Japanese forces in almost all parts of the empire, especially from 1937-1945. However, it is one pattern. We will try to evaluate some specific features of the Nanjing episode and then ask how it might have differed in scale and severity from some other areas and times.
* We'll spend the other roughly half of our session on exploring the idea of Kōminka and discussing what this phase of Japanese empire means in relation to earlier periods.

**Questions:**

1. Discuss the differences or similarities in the portrayal of the Japanese as urban occupiers in the Documents on the Rape of Nanking with the depiction of the same in Aso's memoir From Shanghai to Shangai
2. What is Kōminka, and what is distinct about it compared to earlier colonial efforts, especially in Taiwan and Korea?

**Preparation:**

* Following things chronologically, this would normally where many books or classes on Japanese history would turn to Pearl Harbor, to the war in the Pacific, and the dropping of the atomic bomb on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. These were monumental events in the history of the climatic conflict between the United States and Japan and, domestically, are what stand out the most for the people of Japan and the United States today. However, what is often neglected with this focus, and what had a broader long term impact on the entire history of a region is the massive invasion by Japan in late 1941 of almost all of southeast Asia and the destruction of European colonial power there. This was the last disastrous stage of Japanese imperialism.
* Put your main priority on working on your long essay (half the preparation time at least) which should be well along by now.
* The primary sources this week are long, but you may not only skim the works as needed, but might have the pleasure of reading the entirety of a single longer piece for perhaps the first time this semester. Use this as an opportunity to analyse this source critically and look for patterns and interesting features.
* Consider choosing a chapter from Lebra in the secondary sources to dovetail the primary source. For example, if you read the Ba Maw text, then consider reading the Burma Independence Army chapter in Lebra.
* If you are unfamiliar with it, look up the general history of the Burmese, Indian, and British Malayan colonies to get oriented a bit. 

**Overview:**

* There may be assessed presentations
* Short Lecture and Group Task: We'll spend a good portion of our class today comparing notes with each other (hopefully we will have a good balance of students who read each of the primary sources) on the experience of Japan's "sudden rampage" as one book title calls it, through Southeast Asia.
* Group Task: We will again meet and discuss the experience of working on the second prospectus or critical review, and discuss progress on the long essay. 
* Time permitting we'll discuss conscription and colonial soldiering in general, and compare the case of Korean and Taiwanese fighting for Japan with the auxiliaries of Southeast Asia.

**Questions:**

1. How did the "double occupations" of southeast Asia (western colonialism and Japanese occupation) make serve to make Japan's war a particularly complex memory for the peoples of southeast Asia?
2. The period from 1941-1945 is called the "Pacific War" and many of the films, books, and indeed classes about this period are taught as the war between Japan and the United States. Reflect on what goes missing from a narrative of this period as a US-Japanese war.

### Week 9 - Long Essay Discussion and Pair Writing

**Preparation**

There is no assigned reading for this session. The time you would otherwise spend reading for our seminar should be dedicated entirely to work on your long essay. Take good advantage of this time.

Please bring your laptop or tablet to class for this session.

By this point in the semester, you should have made good progress on your long essay and composed at least some portion of it. This might be a first attempt at the introduction, an analytical passage articulating some important argument you wish to make, or an anecdote which provides a piece of support for your argument. It is tempting to have only a detailed outline at this point, but there is a very long way between the beautiful structure apparent on an outline and the reality of text on a screen. Please bring some portion of what you have written, no more than a single printed page in length with you. We will proceed as follows:

1. 30m - First we will form small groups, exchange some of the written work we have done so far, read it silently for 10 minutes, and then have a discussion. Each student can discuss some of their challenges in the research so far, ask for help, and give each other general feedback.

2. 25m - We will form pairs and do a 'pair writing' exercise. During this time one student, the 'driver' will write on their long essay. This can be a direct continuation of what they have already written, a new section, or more casual free flowing of ideas about their paper. If you like, you can write a summary of your essay as a whole. If you are behind in your work, you can write an updated 'prospectus' discussing the direction you are hoping to develop the essay. As you do this, your partner, the 'observer' will sit beside you and watch you write, offering occasional feedback, suggestions, or pose questions to you about what you write. If you struggle with a phrase or an idea, your partner should offer you help. 

3. 25m - After a five minute break, we will switch driver/observer to allow the other partner to write. Same as above.

4. 30m - Finally we will re-form as a class and share thoughts on the experience and offer each other concrete suggestions on how to overcome problems faced so far, or where to proceed. Did you learn anything from the style or approach of your partner? Did you get any new ideas from interacting with others either in the groups early on or in the partner writing exercise?

**Overview**

* We will split this class in three: a discussion on the Tokyo War Crimes trials, a group exercise based on some treason trial documents provided to you the week before, and then a short lecture and broader discussion of the aftermaths of war more broadly across what was once the Japanese empire.
* There may be presentations

**Questions:**

1. What make's Pal's dissenting opinion an unusual document for the age? What is left unsaid? What different ways can a document like the opinion be used?
2. What are the biggest challenges to conducting a legal reckoning with the past in the aftermath of the war?
3. What are some of the ways in which Japan's decolonization is unique among the major empires of the world?

**Overview:**

* There may be presentations
* This week we will examine some of the issues that have collectively come to be referred to as the "history problem" in Japan, including issues related to depictions of empire and war in textbooks and the similar rise of previously neglected voices in the 1980s and 1990s. 
* What some of these better known issues don't capture well is how challenging the issue of war and empire is for institutions and communities all throughout Japan. Clubs, families, municipal governments, libraries, religious organizations etc. all have had there own challenges to face the long history of Japanese empire and war. In order to focus in a bit, we will examine one case study in more detail: the role of Zen buddhism. Victoria's readings give you both a look into Zen's relationship with the Japanese state during our period (though keep in mind, Zen buddhists have by no means a unique story to tell here), along with some of the postwar story of their confrontation (or lack of) with their contribution to Japanese empire and wartime expansion. 
* We will set some time aside to review the handbook section on the final exam, discuss the plan for the review session next week, and strategies for preparing for the take-home exam.
