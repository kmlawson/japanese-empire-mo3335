## Exam

The final examination is a take-home exam worth 40% of your total assessment for the module. The questions (six will be presented, of which you choose three), will be made available online through our MMS at the appointed start time, and you will be required to submit the answers within 10 hours online to the MMS. The exam is designed to only take you a few hours (3-5 hours of writing, there is a strict word limit of 3750 words total for all three answers combined) but to give you the freedom to complete it at a time that works for you, as well as other benefits such as: giving you the freedom to draft and initial answer and then review notes to strengthen areas you feel are weak before returning to complete the final version.

Those who are not experienced with this format often make one critical mistake: They see the questions, and immediately begin a long and intensive process of reading and reviewing on the questions before beginning the writing process towards the end of the allotted time. I strongly urge students not to take this approach as it does not, in my experience, produced the strongest answers. You tend to become exhausted and produce poor quality answers, answer in far too much empirical detail but often straying from the question, and sometimes finding yourself critically short on time or sloppy in execution. I strongly encourage you to consider the following approach: 

* View the questions
* Review your existing notes and draft out an outline for half an hour or so 
* Write a full draft of all three answers, even if they are only half complete in terms of word count
* Read over your work as a marker might and find the areas you think are weak
* Eat a meal or snack, take a nice break, go for a walk, have a nap, do something fun
* Read over your notes or return to the original texts to address the weaknesses in your answer
* Revise your drafted answers and submit the exam

Questions for the exam typically will strive to get you to think synthetically, to make observations and comparisons across the themes of the semester, and as such should show an ability to make sharp analytical arguments, combined with the ability to employ a few detailed empirical examples to support these arguments.

The exam uses a modified citation practice for the exam and does not need any footnotes or a bibliography because the body of evidence you are using should consist of our course readings (whether those are the required weekly readings or supplemental readings from each week). You should not have to do any outside reading for the exam, and in fact, the questions do not assume that you have done any of the further reading. In fact, doing outside reading beyond works listed in our required or further reading show that you have not sufficiently digested our existing available material. Thus, for citation, you need only indicate the author last name (when only one work by them, a short version of title if there are multiple works by same author) and a page number. Quotes should be kept to a very minimum but you should cite where you are taking arguments and ideas from, as in any essay. Example: Lawson makes the argument that ... (Lawson, 233). If we have read multiple works by an author during the semester, add the title as well, or make it clear in your sentence which work you are referring to. If, for some reason, you really want to include an outside reading to support your argument, then you must follow the School of History Style Guide citation practices, and the footnote will be included in your overall word count.

Previous versions of the examination are available, as with most classes at St Andrews, through the online portal for that purpose.

If you have any problems submitting the exam through MMS, please email a copy of it to me before the deadline. It is critical that you get the exam submitted by the appointed time so please leave enough time to make sure you have uploaded the exam to MMS or at least emailed me a copy.

Questions to ask yourself as you prepare for the exam throughout the semester:

* Important: Do I have printed, photocopies, or digital versions of the texts I need so that I am not dependent on either an internet connection or the short loan process should I want to look up any particular references?
* Do have I have good notes for each of the readings?
* Do have I have good "notes on notes" which further filters and reduces my notes down to more general points and arguments, and make it easier to refer to or look up more specific notes or text references?
* Have I kept track of page numbers for key arguments or key evidence/examples so that I can easily find/cite them for the exam?
* Have I worked together with some of my fellow classmates before the exam as I prepare, comparing notes, discussing past exam questions, and sharing reference information.
* Have I consulted the collaborative class notes before the exam and incorporated useful information there, or from the presentation handouts throughout the semester so that I am better prepared?
* Have I thought about ways to connect readings to each other and into larger themes that may bridge across weeks?

Questions to ask yourself as you review over your answers on the examination:

* Did I state my answer concisely and clearly at the outset?
* Did I use evidence from our readings to support my answer?
* Did I use some specific examples to support my answer?
* Was everything in my answer relevant to the question as asked?
* Have I included a parenthetical citation for each of the claims I make which come from the module reading?
