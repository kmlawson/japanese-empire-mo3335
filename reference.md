### Special Circumstances - 'S' coding
‘S’ Coding is the method the University uses to recognise that special circumstances have affected performance in the modules concerned. ‘S’ coding may only be applied to Honours or taught postgraduate modules, except for taught postgraduate project or dissertation modules which are excluded. ‘S’ coding may only be applied with the explicit consent of the student and with the approval of the School. The final decision to ‘S’ code a module grade rests with the School. You should be aware that a maximum of 25% of the overall Honours credits required or 50% of the taught element of a postgraduate award may be ‘S’ coded.

If you feel that most or all of the work of a module has been adversely affected by personal circumstances during your final junior and senior Honours years or during the taught modules of a taught postgraduate programme you should contact your School in the first instance indicating the circumstances of the difficulty experienced. This may relate to ongoing illness, close family bereavement or other significant personal difficulties.

You must bring this information to the attention of the School as soon as possible as there are a number of ways to deal with such situations, ‘S’ coding being the final option. It may be possible (and it is viewed as preferable) to arrange deferred assessments or extended submission dates rather than applying ‘S’ to the entire module. However, it should be noted that if such arrangements are made (extensions or deferred assessments etc.) it is unlikely that you will be entitled to have the module ‘S’ coded as well.
Academic appeals, complaints and disciplinary issues

The University is committed to ensuring as high a quality student experience as possible while studying at St Andrews. Occasionally things may go wrong and if you are experiencing a difficulty, or are dissatisfied with your academic experience, you should raise concerns as soon as possible. This allows effective resolutions to be worked out quickly.

Such issues normally fall into one of three categories:

* An appeal requesting a formal review of an academic decision - where, for example, the University has made a judgement about your assessed work or progression within a course of study which you have grounds to query (see the relevant Policy on Student Academic Appeals);
* Complaints  - where you are dissatisfied with the quality or standard of service that you have received from any part of the University, either academic or non-academic (see the University’s Complaints Handling Procedure);
* Disciplinary cases - where the University has grounds to believe that you have conducted yourself in an unacceptable manner in either an academic or non-academic context. Academic Misconduct is dealt with under the Good Academic Practice Policy; Non-Academic Misconduct is dealt with under separate procedures.
If there are extenuating personal circumstances that may affect your academic performance or impact on your progression you must bring these to the attention of an appropriate member of staff (for example your Academic Adviser, module coordinator or the appropriate Pro Dean) as soon as possible and normally prior to completing any assessment. If you base a subsequent academic appeal on such extenuating personal circumstances, you will be required to provide valid reasons to explain why you failed to notify the examiners or other relevant persons of these circumstances prior to completing the assessment.

### Using the Right Procedure
If you are unsure whether to use the Appeals procedure or the Complaints procedure, there is a key question to ask yourself. What kind of outcome are you seeking?  If you are seeking to have an academic decision changed (such as a mark or grade, a decision about progression, or termination of studies), then you must use the Appeals procedure. The permissible grounds for submitting an appeal are clearly detailed therein. If you are dissatisfied with the level of service you have received from the University, or if you believe that a service needs to be improved, or that the University has failed (for example) to follow one of its administrative processes properly, then the Complaints procedure is normally more appropriate. For matters involving teaching in general, there are also feedback opportunities through Staff-Student Consultative Councils, module questionnaires and School presidents.

You can make both a personal Complaint and an Appeal, by using both the Appeal and Complaints procedures, but it must be emphasised that changing an academic judgment or decision is not one of the outcomes from the Complaints procedure used alone.

### Further guidance and support
The Students' Association provides independent and confidential help and advice for students who are contemplating submitting an academic appeal, complaint or are having discipline proceedings taken against them. The Students' Association employs Iain Cupples, the Student Advocate (Education), whose job it is to ensure that you receive help with writing and submitting a submission. Iain can also accompany you to any hearing. He should be your first point of contact as soon as you feel you need help.

### Termination of Studies on Academic Grounds – Undergraduates
If your academic performance is unsatisfactory, i.e. you have gained insufficient credits to progress to the next stage of your degree programme, your studies may be terminated. You will then be notified by the Dean or the Pro Dean (Advising) that your studies are terminated and you will normally have no more than five working days to request a review of this decision using the appropriate form. This should be supported by documentary evidence specifying the reasons for your unsatisfactory performance. If you do not submit a request for review of the decision you will have your studies automatically terminated. This decision is taken by the Dean in accordance with Senate Regulations.  Your full student record is taken into account in any review, including any instances of non-academic misconduct.

If your request for review is successful, the Dean will contact you with conditions for your return to studies. If you do not meet these conditions (e.g. you do not pass the specified amount of credits within the time period given by the Dean) your studies may be terminated again.

If your request for review is unsuccessful, you may have a further right of appeal to the Senate of the University. Appeals to Senate are admissible only on limited grounds and the process cannot be used to challenge matters of academic judgment. To make a Senate submission, you must complete and submit to the Senate Office a Stage 2 appeal form within 10 working days of the date stated on your termination letter. Late submissions may not be considered further by the University. For further information, see the University’s Policy on Student Academic Appeals at http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/students/rules/appeals/policy/
International students here at St Andrews on a Tier 4 visa should be aware that any terminations will be reported to the UKVI and their visa curtailed.

### Absence from Classes
Attendance is a basic assessment requirement for credit award, and failure to attend classes or meetings with academic staff may result in your losing the right to be assessed in that module. Please ensure that you are familiar with the 'Academic Alert' policy as stated elsewhere in this handbook.  If you have missed timetabled classes/events or any other compulsory elements of the module due to illness or an unavoidable pre-arranged event or appointment, you must complete a Self Certificate of Absence form (through e-Vision) as soon as possible.

Under certain circumstances, Schools may request further documentation in addition to the Self Certificate. In this case, students should contact Student Services in order to organise the appropriate documentation.  If you submit more than three Self Certificates in a single semester, or if the period of absence extends to fifteen working days, you may be contacted by Student Services, the relevant Pro Dean, or by an appropriate member of staff in your School.

Completion of a Self Certificate is not an acceptable substitute for contacting your tutors well in advance if you have to be absent. Advance notice of absence is acceptable only for good reason (for example, a hospital appointment or job interview). It is your responsibility to contact the appropriate member of staff to complete any remedial work necessary.

If you are an international student (non-EEA nationals only), you will be affected by recent changes introduced by the UK in relation to immigration rules and visas. The University is now legally bound to report to the UKVI any student who fails to enrol on a module or programme of study, or who fails to attend, or who discontinues their studies.

### Absence from Examinations
Absence from Examinations due to illness or any other unavoidable reason should be reported by submitting a  Self Certificate of Absence form (through e-Vision) as soon as you are able to do so, preferably before the examination is due to take place and in any case no later than 24 hours after the examination.  You must contact the School responsible for the module being examined in order to request alternative arrangements, which are at the discretion of the School.   You are only required to notify the University Examinations Officer if there is a problem submitting the self-certificate.

### Deferred Assessment

http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/media/teaching-and-learning/policies/Assess Policies Procedures.pdf. 

### Deans' List
This is an annual award for academic excellence, promoted by the Deans of the University. Undergraduate and Postgraduate Taught students who achieve an outstanding overall result in the course of an academic year have their names inscribed on the Deans’ List, an honour which will also appear on your University transcript.  The criteria for the award are strict. Only students taking no fewer than 120 credits counting towards an approved degree programme over the course of an academic year will be eligible and all credits have to be taken within the four Faculties of the University of St Andrews. Any student who meets all the criteria and who obtains a credit-weighted mean grade of 16.5 or above for the year will be recorded on the Deans’ List. The rules will be adapted for part-time students, who must achieve the minimum credit-weighted mean of 16.5 in 120 credits taken part-time over no more than three academic sessions. Full details of all the criteria and conditions for the Deans’ List are available at     
https://www.standrews.ac.uk/students/academic/awards/universityprizes/deanslist/ and

### Laidlaw Undergraduate Internship Program
The Laidlaw Undergraduate Internship Programme in Research and Leadership is sponsored by a generous donation from The Rt Hon Lord Laidlaw of Rothiemay, an honorary graduate of the University. This exciting summer vacation Programme, now in its second year, equips students with the skills and values to become leaders in their chosen occupations beyond University.

Interns will design, pursue and report on a research question of their own devising working on this research with an academic in their chosen School during the summer vacation. Importantly, interns will also complete two intensive, bespoke Leadership training sessions.

This programme is open to undergraduate students in their penultimate year of study. Vacation projects last between 8 and 10 weeks; interns are supported with a weekly stipend of £400.  In addition those who successfully complete their internship will also be awarded a further £1000 in their final year of study as part of the Excellence Bursary.  Applications open on 5 October.  Please see the Laidlaw website for more information at   
http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/students/involve/laidlaw/.

### Undergraduate Research Assistantship Scheme (URAS)
This programme was introduced to promote projects that emphasise the many ways in which Research and Teaching can come together and to give undergraduate students the opportunity to gain experience doing independent research. The URAS is open to any undergraduate student matriculated at the University of St Andrews.  URAS funding (currently at £50 per 6 hours of work, up to £2,000 per school) cannot be used to support research for a credit-bearing programme. The programme is administered by the Proctor’s Office.  For full details of the application process visit www.st-andrews.ac.uk/students/academic/internships/

### Illegible Exam Scripts 
It is your responsibility to ensure that your handwritten answers provided in examination scripts are legible and can be read by the markers. If a script cannot be read by the marker then this could result in a delay in confirming your module grade.  You may be charged for a transcription service and could be required to return to the School(s) concerned in order to transcribe the script.  If you have already left St Andrews then you will have to bear the costs of any return travel to the University.   More information is available at: https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/media/teaching-and-learning/policies/illegible-scripts.pdf

### Recording Devices in Lectures
If you have a disability or some medical condition which means that you are unable to take notes in lectures, you may seek permission from Student Services to use a voice recorder or other computer-based device to record lectures and/or tutorials.  If you are not authorised by Student Services to record lectures then you must request permission from the relevant academic member of staff prior to the lecture taking place.  More information is available at:- https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/media/teaching-and-learning/policies/recording-lectures.pdf

### Academic Flexibility for Students with Recognised Sporting Talent
There is a policy which allows eligible students (with the permission of the School and Sports Performance Manager) to have time off from their studies in order to participate in key sporting tournaments and competitions.  Further information is available from Debby Sargent, Department of Sport and Exercise (email dls4) or see   
http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/media/teaching-and-learning/policies/sports%20flexibility.pdf

### Degree Regulations
A regulatory structure determined by Senate and Court governs the award of all degrees. Undergraduate and Postgraduate Resolutions and Regulations are available at https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/students/rules/ugsenateregulations/ and https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/pgstudents/rules/pgsenateregulations/.

### Leave of Absence
Note to schools: A new Leave of Absence policy came into effect in May 2015. Please ensure you reference the most up to date policy, which can be found at https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/media/teaching-and-learning/policies/LOA.pdf.

### Withdrawal from Studies
If you are considering withdrawing from your studies at the University you should discuss the matter with your Adviser of Studies in the first instance or your Supervisor if you are a Research Postgraduate student. You should arrange to do this as early as possible as there are often alternative options open to you that would not require the final step of permanent withdrawal from the University. If you do decide you wish to withdraw from your studies you must contact the appropriate Pro Dean who will be able to offer guidance on your options and who will ensure that the process is completed correctly.  You should be aware that there are fee implications, as well as implications to your leave to remain in the UK if you are an overseas student, when you withdraw from your studies part of the way through an academic year. You should therefore ensure you contact the Money Adviser and the International Adviser in Student Services to obtain early advice on the final implications of your decision before you complete your withdrawal.

### Academic Alerts 
Academic Alerts are a way of helping students who are having trouble coping with their studies, such as missing deadlines for handing in work, or missing compulsory tutorials. The aim of the Alert system is to help students by flagging up problems before they seriously affect students’ grades. Academic Alerts will be issued by email from the Director of Teaching, Director of Postgraduate Studies, Module Coordinator or School administrator and will tell students what is wrong and what they are required to do (e.g. attend classes in future).  The Alerts will also tell students what support the University can offer. If students do not take the action required they will get another Alert, and eventually will automatically get a grade of zero and will fail that module. The system is designed to help and support students in order to remedy any problems or issues before these lead to failing a module. Alerts will never appear on a student’s permanent transcript. For more information on Academic Alerts and details on how the categories work, see http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/media/teaching-and-learning/policies/Academic%20Alerts.pdf

### Penalties for Late Work and/or Work of Incorrect Length

See https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/media/teaching-and-learning/policies/penalties.pdf

### Student Fees

Graduating in person or in absentia marks the end of your degree or diploma course of studies at the University of St Andrews. If you have been accepted onto a new degree or diploma programme at the University, the new programme is separate and distinct from the course of studies from which you are about to graduate, and you will be liable for all fees associated with that new programme.

### Disability Support

If you require support for disability reasons, for example teaching and exam arrangements, please contact the Disability Team in Student Services who can provide support for a wide range of disabilities such as learning difficulties, visual and hearing impairments, mobility difficulties, Asperger’s, mental health, long standing medical condition and much more.
