## Absence from Classes

Attendance is a basic assessment requirement for credit award, and failure to attend classes or meetings with academic staff may result in your losing the right to be assessed in that module. Please ensure that you are familiar with the Academic Alerts regulations.

If you have missed timetabled classes/events or any other compulsory elements of the module due to illness or an unavoidable pre-arranged event or appointment, you must complete a Self Certificate of Absence.

Under certain circumstances, Schools may request further documentation in addition to the Self Certificate.  In this case, students should contact Student Support in order to organise the appropriate documentation.

If you submit more than three Self Certificates in a single semester, or if the period of absence extends to fifteen working days, you may be contacted by Student Support, the relevant Pro Dean, or by an appropriate member of staff in your School.

Completion of a Self Certificate is not an acceptable substitute for contacting your tutors well in advance if you have to be absent. Advance notice of absence is acceptable only for good reason (for example, a hospital appointment or job interview).   It is your responsibility to contact the appropriate member of staff to complete any remedial work necessary.

If you are an international student (non-EEA nationals only), you will be affected by recent changes introduced by the UK in relation to immigration rules and visas.  The University is now legally bound to report to the United Kingdom Borders Agency any student who fails to enrol on a module or programme of study or who fails to attend or who discontinues their studies.

## Emails

If you have a question that requires an answer with significant detail, please consider asking during office hours, or at the beginning or end of class. If the email requires a particularly long answer, I may ask you to bring the question up again after our next class or in office hours. I will strive to offer a reply to emails received within 48 hours, whenever possible. Emails are usually not responded to over the weekend and may not even be read until Monday.

In writing emails, please try to be clear about what you are asking, and keep in mind that your message is one among many from students of multiple classes and differing contexts. Please mention which course you are in and what specific matter you are referring to. As in class, feel free to address me by first name in emails.

Finally, before hitting the send button, please confirm that the answer to your question is not found in the handbook, on official school websites, or other handouts provided to the class.

## Laptops in Class

Recent studies are increasingly showing that, for whatever reasons, the handwriting of notes, and the reading of essays on physical paper as opposed to computers or other reading devices increases the quality of notes, significantly boosts recall, and better processing of content in general.

There are, however, many strong benefits to using a laptop for notes, and keeping reading content in digital form, not the least ready access, easy distribution, ability to re-sort notes, searchability, and for those who have handwriting as poor as mine: simple readability. 

You are welcome to bring a laptop to class and use it for notes and reading. If you do not, I ask that you bring printed copies of assigned reading that is made available every week so that you can easily refer to the readings as we discuss them. Not bringing them makes for very ineffective use of a seminar that is based on the discussion of reading. 

Please do not to use applications not related to our class, including email applications and social media. It is not only that you are interfering with your own learning and showing your tutor disrespect, but it is a severe distraction to anyone sitting next to you.

## Collective Notes

I believe in the benefits of sharing notes, not only with your classmates, but with future potential students of the class. For this purpose, I have created, and will provide the link for a Google document where you can post readings, organize reference material and online links to info and sources, etc. throughout the semester. I will also provide a link to notes from previous years (which may include some different readings and seminar topics). Both present and past years should be treated as you might any historical source: you should not use them to replace your own reading and note taking, and you should not treat content and notes provided by others as something you can uncritically accept as accurate. Use them as a productive supplement, as an alternative perspective as you conduct your own studies.

## Exam

The final examination is a take-home exam. The questions (six, of which you choose three), will be made available online through our MMS at the appointed start time, and you will be required to submit the answers within 24 hours online to the MMS. The exam is still designed to only take you a few hours (3-5 hours, there are strict word limits) but to give you the freedom to complete it at a time that works for you, as well as other benefits such as: giving you the freedom to draft and initial answer and then review notes to strengthen areas you feel are weak before returning to complete the final version.

Those are not experienced with this format often make one critical mistake: They see the questions, and immediately begin a long and intensive process of reading and reviewing on the questions before beginning the writing process. This has never, in my experience, produced the strongest replies. You tend to become exhausted and produce poor quality answers, answer in great empirical detail but stray from the question, and sometimes find yourself critically short on time and sleep.

I strongly encourage you to attempt the following approach: 

* View the questions
* Review your existing notes and draft out an outline for half an hour to an hour
* Write a full draft of all three answers
* Read over your work and find the areas you think are weak
* Read over your notes or return to the original texts for another hour or two
* Revise your drafted answers either immediately, or later in the day, or after a good night's sleep.

Questions for the exam typically will strive to get you to think synthetically, to make observations and comparisons across the themes of the semester, and as such should show an ability to make sharp analytical arguments, combined with the ability to employ a few detailed empirical examples to support these arguments

The exam uses a modified citation practice for the exam and does not need any footnotes. You should not have to do any outside reading for the exam. Indeed, doing outside reading beyond works listed show that you have not sufficiently digested our existing material. Thus, for citation, you need only indicate the author last name (when only one work by them, a short version of title if there are multiple works by same author) and a page number. Quotes should be kept to a very minimum but you should cite where you are taking arguments and ideas from, as in any essay.

Previous versions of the examination are available, as with most classes at St Andrews, through the online portal for that purpose.
