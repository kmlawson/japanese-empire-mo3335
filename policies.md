## Absence from Classes

Attendance is a basic assessment requirement for credit award, and failure to attend classes or meetings with academic staff may result in your losing the right to be assessed in that module. Please ensure that you are familiar with the Academic Alerts regulations.

If you have missed timetabled classes/events or any other compulsory elements of the module due to illness or an unavoidable pre-arranged event or appointment, you must complete a Self Certificate of Absence.

Under certain circumstances, Schools may request further documentation in addition to the Self Certificate.  In this case, students should contact Student Support in order to organise the appropriate documentation.

If you submit more than three Self Certificates in a single semester, or if the period of absence extends to fifteen working days, you may be contacted by Student Support, the relevant Pro Dean, or by an appropriate member of staff in your School.

Completion of a Self Certificate is not an acceptable substitute for contacting your tutors well in advance if you have to be absent. Advance notice of absence is acceptable only for good reason (for example, a hospital appointment or job interview).   It is your responsibility to contact the appropriate member of staff to complete any remedial work necessary.

If you are an international student (non-EEA nationals only), you will be affected by recent changes introduced by the UK in relation to immigration rules and visas.  The University is now legally bound to report to the United Kingdom Borders Agency any student who fails to enrol on a module or programme of study or who fails to attend or who discontinues their studies.

## Emails

If you have a question that requires an answer with significant detail, please consider asking during office hours, or at the beginning or end of class. If the email requires a particularly long answer, I may ask you to bring the question up again after our next class or in office hours. I will strive to offer a reply to emails received within 48 hours, whenever possible. Emails are usually not responded to over the weekend and may not even be read until Monday.

In writing emails, please try to be clear about what you are asking, and keep in mind that your message is one among many from students of multiple classes and differing contexts. Please mention which course you are in and what specific matter you are referring to. As in class, feel free to address me by first name in emails.
