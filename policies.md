## Emails

If you have a question that requires an answer with significant detail, please consider asking during office hours, or at the beginning or end of class. If the email requires a particularly long answer, I may ask you to bring the question up again after our next class or in office hours. I will strive to offer a reply to emails received within 48 hours, whenever possible. Emails are usually not responded to over the weekend and may not even be read until Monday.

In writing emails, please try to be clear about what you are asking, and keep in mind that your message is one among many from students of multiple classes and differing contexts. Please mention which course you are in and what specific matter you are referring to. As in class, feel free to address me by first name in emails.

Finally, before hitting the send button, please confirm that the answer to your question is not found in the handbook, on official school websites, or other handouts provided to the class.

## Laptops in Class

Recent studies are increasingly showing that, for whatever reasons, the handwriting of notes, and the reading of essays on physical paper as opposed to computers or other reading devices increases the quality of notes, significantly boosts recall, and better processing of content in general.

There are, however, many strong benefits to using a laptop for notes, and keeping reading content in digital form, not the least ready access, easy distribution, ability to re-sort notes, searchability, and for those who have handwriting as poor as mine: simple readability. 

You are welcome to bring a laptop to class and use it for notes and reading. If you do not bring a laptop, I ask that you bring printed copies of assigned reading that is made available every week so that you can easily refer to the readings as we discuss them. Not bringing them makes for very ineffective use of a seminar that is based on the discussion of reading. 

Please do not to use applications not related to our class, including email applications and social media. It is not only that you are interfering with your own learning and showing your tutor disrespect, but it is a severe distraction to anyone sitting next to you.

## Collective Notes

I believe in the benefits of sharing notes, not only with your classmates, but with future potential students of the class. For this purpose, I have created, and will provide the link for a Google document where you can post readings, organize reference material and online links to info and sources, etc. throughout the semester. I will also provide a link to notes from previous years (which may include some different readings and seminar topics). Both present and past years should be treated as you might any historical source: you should not use them to replace your own reading and note taking, and you should not treat content and notes provided by others as something you can uncritically accept as accurate. Use them as a productive supplement, as an alternative perspective as you conduct your own studies.

## Knowledge Transfer and Ongoing Feedback

The collective notes document is one example of how communication can happen from one year of students in this module to the next. In addition to this, as coordinator, I share my own thoughts about how the ways in which the module worked or fell short online here:

There are also links to a repository containing the full history of changes to this handbook over time. The reflections on the course include some selections from student feedback. I value your evaluations a great deal and take them, both the formal evaluation at the end of the semester, and any feedback informally received during the course of the semester, very seriously. Please do not hesitate to share with me your concerns as well as suggestions for how you think the module might be improved in the future. I also encourage all students to consider including advice to future students of the module in the shared collective notes document, especially suggestions on the selection of topics, research, and the writing process.
