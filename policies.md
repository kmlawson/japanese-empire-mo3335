## Policies 

**Marking**

Within the School of History all work is assessed on a scale of 1-20 with intervals of 0.5. Module outcomes are reported using the same scale but with intervals of 0.1. The assessment criteria set out below are not comprehensive, but are intended to provide guidance in interpreting grades and improving the quality of assessed work. Students should bear in mind that presentation is an important element of assessment and that failure to adhere to the guidelines set out in the School of History Style Sheet will be penalised.

The marking scale can be found here:

**Extensions**

**Prior** permissions for late submission of work ("Extensions") to make fair allowance for adverse circumstances affecting a student's ability to submit the work on time will be considered on a case by case basis. Normally such permissions will only be granted for circumstances that are both unforeseen and beyond the student's control.

**Word Limits and Late Work**

It is important to work consistently through the semester and work around your other commitments and deadlines. Plan ahead and don't save your work until the last minute. Assessed work with word limits should be always submitted within those limits. Writing in a clear and concise manner, and being able to structure and execute an argument that may be shorter than you feel is required is a skill that is of great use in academic fields as well as the workplace beyond. Please do not go over the limit and force yourself to work within them as a practice that will be important for writing assignments in your future careers. 

The official School of Histories penalties for late work and short/long work are followed in this module:

**Please Note**: In this module you will not be penalised for a *long essay* that goes over the requested word range but is less than 10,000 words. This exception applies **only** to the long essay. Having dedicated a semester to your project, some students find that they wish to compose an essay that begins to approach or even reaches the length of a typical academic article (they are typically 8-10,000). While that is certainly not required or recommended, nor is it necessarily a good way to aim for a high mark, but I will not let our word limit stand in the way of a potentially well-developed longer student essay. 

**Absence from Classes**

Please see this document for more on Student Absence:

**Emails**

If you have a question that requires an answer with significant detail, please consider asking during office hours, or at the beginning or end of class. Please avoid sending emails that require more than a very brief answer. If the email requires a substantive answer, I may ask you to bring the question up again after our next class or in office hours. I will strive to offer a reply to emails received within 48 hours, whenever possible. Emails are usually not responded to over the weekend and may not even be read until Monday. In writing emails, please try to be clear about what you are asking, and keep in mind that your message is one among many from students of multiple classes and differing contexts. Please mention which course you are in and what specific matter you are referring to. As in class, feel free to address me by first name in emails. Finally, before hitting the send button, please confirm that the answer to your question is not found in the handbook, on official school websites, or other handouts provided to the class.

**Laptops in Class**

Recent studies are increasingly showing that, for whatever reasons, the handwriting of notes, and the reading of essays on physical paper as opposed to computers or other reading devices increases the quality of notes, significantly boosts recall, and better processing of content in general.

There are, however, many benefits to using a laptop for notes, and keeping reading content in digital form, not the least ready access, easy distribution, ability to re-sort notes, searchability, and for those who have handwriting as poor as mine: simple readability. 

You are welcome to bring a laptop to class and use it for notes and reading. If you do not bring a laptop, I ask that you bring either printed or photocopied copies of assigned reading that is made available every week or else good notes so that you can easily refer to the readings as we discuss them. It is especially important that you have copies of assigned primary sources with you and not bringing them makes for very ineffective use of a seminar that is based on the discussion of reading. 

Please do not to use applications on your laptop not related to our class, including email applications and social media. Obviously they will interfere with your own concentration but that is not the primary concern: using other applications on your laptop is a severe distraction to anyone sitting next to you.

**Collective Notes**

I believe in the benefits of sharing notes, not only with your classmates, but with future potential students of the class. For this purpose, I have created, and will provide the link for a Google document where you can post readings, organize reference material and online links to info and sources, etc. throughout the semester. I will also provide a link to notes from previous years (which may include some different readings and seminar topics). Both present and past years should be treated as you might any historical source: you should not use them to replace your own reading and note taking, and you should not treat content and notes provided by others as something you can uncritically accept as accurate. Use them as a productive supplement, as an alternative perspective as you conduct your own studies.

**Knowledge Transfer and Ongoing Feedback**

The collective notes document is one example of how communication can happen from one year of students in this module to the next. In addition to this, as coordinator, I share my own thoughts about how the ways in which the module worked or fell short online here:

There are also links to a repository containing the full history of changes to this handbook over time. The reflections on the course include some selections from student feedback. I value your evaluations a great deal and take them, both the formal evaluation at the end of the semester, and any feedback informally received during the course of the semester, very seriously. Please do not hesitate to share with me your concerns as well as suggestions for how you think the module might be improved in the future. I also encourage all students to consider including advice to future students of the module in the shared collective notes document, especially suggestions on the selection of topics, research, and the writing process.

**Academic Misconduct and Plagiarism**

Academic integrity is fundamental to the values promoted by the University. It is important that all students are judged on their ability, and that no student is allowed unfairly to take an advantage over others, to affect the security and integrity of the assessment process, or to diminish the reliability and quality of a St Andrews degree.

If you are unsure about the correct presentation of academic material, you should approach your tutor. You can also contact CAPOD, which provides an extensive range of training on Academic Skills.
