## Marking

Within the School of History all work is assessed on a scale of 1-20 with intervals of 0.5. Module outcomes are reported using the same scale but with intervals of 0.1. The assessment criteria set out below are not comprehensive, but are intended to provide guidance in interpreting grades and improving the quality of assessed work. Students should bear in mind that presentation is an important element of assessment and that failure to adhere to the guidelines set out in the School of History Style Sheet will be penalised.

Upper Second Class work will be distinguished in some or all of the following ways: clarity and rigour of argument and structure, well directed at the title; thorough coverage of recommended reading; intelligent use of primary sources; historiographical awareness; well chosen examples; comparison e.g. with themes and topics covered in other modules; clarity of style.  

**Lower Second Class**: 10.5, 11.0, 11.5, 12.0, 12.5, 13.0    
Lower Second Class work will have some of the following features: some evidence of knowledge and understanding, but limitations in clarity and rigour of argument and structure; restricted coverage of recommended reading; restricted use of primary sources; weaknesses of style; failure to address the title set.  

**Third Class**: 7.5, 8.0, 8.5, 9.0, 9.5, 10.0

**Fail (with the right to re-assessment)**: 4.0, 4.5, 5.0, 5.5, 6.0, 6.5  
Work with very serious deficiencies that falls below the required standard, failing to address the literature with the seriousness required and with an inadequate grasp of the subject matter and of historical analysis.   

**Fail (without the right to re-assessment)**: 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, 3.5   
Work so weak as to indicate that only a nominal attempt has been made to complete the assignment, or that it displays virtually total confusion and misunderstanding of the subject.  

**Unclassifiable**: 0  
No acceptable work presented.   

## Absence from Classes

Attendance is a basic assessment requirement for credit award, and failure to attend classes or meetings with academic staff may result in your losing the right to be assessed in that module. Please ensure that you are familiar with the Academic Alerts regulations.

If you have missed timetabled classes/events or any other compulsory elements of the module due to illness or an unavoidable pre-arranged event or appointment, you must complete a Self Certificate of Absence form (through e-Vision) as soon as possible.

https://e-vision.st-andrews.ac.uk/urd/sits.urd/run/siw_lgn

Under certain circumstances, Schools may request further documentation in addition to the Self Certificate.  In this case, students should contact Student Support in order to organise the appropriate documentation.

If you submit more than three Self Certificates in a single semester, or if the period of absence extends to fifteen working days, you may be contacted by Student Support, the relevant Pro Dean, or by an appropriate member of staff in your School.

Completion of a Self Certificate is not an acceptable substitute for contacting your tutors well in advance if you have to be absent. Advance notice of absence is acceptable only for good reason (for example, a hospital appointment or job interview).   It is your responsibility to contact the appropriate member of staff to complete any remedial work necessary.

If you are an international student (non-EEA nationals only), you will be affected by recent changes introduced by the UK in relation to immigration rules and visas.  The University is now legally bound to report to the United Kingdom Borders Agency any student who fails to enrol on a module or programme of study or who fails to attend or who discontinues their studies.
