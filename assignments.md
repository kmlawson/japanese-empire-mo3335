## Assignments

The assessed portion of the coursework for this module consists of one long essay, a presentation, and a short essay. In addition, students are required to come prepared each week having completed the assigned reading and ready to discuss them. A take home exam is given during the exam period at the end of the semester.

**Note:** Paper submissions are **not requested** for any of these. You may upload the submissions directly onto MMS. Your handout for presentations should also be uploaded to the presentation section of MMS by the beginning of class on the day of the presentation, but **hard copies** of this for the class should be brought for distribution to everyone.

### Headers and Formatting

At the top of all your written work or on a cover page, please include:

* The date of submission
* Your student number
* The assignment category you are submitting (e.g. Short Essay, Long Essay, etc.)
* A *specific title* describing the contents (in the case of your prospectus, give a provisional title to the essay it describes)
* The total number of words (use the word count feature of your word processor)

When formatting your assignments, please follow these guidelines:

* Add page numbers
* Use a minimum of 12 sized font
* Use a serif font (such as Times Roman, Georgia, Garamond), not a sans serif font (such as Arial, Helvetica, Verdana)
* Please double space your essays

Other aspects of formatting are highlighted in the School of History style sheet. See the following section.

### Footnotes and References

Please carefully read the St Andrews School of History Style Sheet:

[http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/history/infoug/stylesheet.html](http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/history/infoug/stylesheet.html)

This document, sections 1-4, contains extremely valuable information on how to compose your essay, including how to format your footnotes and bibliography. In particular, please follow the instructions for footnotes carefully. 

In your bibliography, please have separate sections for your secondary sources and the primary sources you used.

If you prefer **and do so consistently**, you may use the Chicago Style (Notes and Bibliography) over the St Andrews note formatting. I encourage you to manage your sources in a referencing tool such as [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) which makes it easy to automatically generate formatted notes and bibliography if you have the correct information for each source.

### Short Essay

You are asked to submit a short essay in the form of a 500 word prospectus for your long essay. For this reason, please read the section on developing a topic and argument for your long essay in the sections below before writing your short essay. The prospectus is an abstract or overview of your (as yet unwritten) long essay, written as if the long essay is already complete. The prospectus is **not** answering the question, "What is this essay *about*" but instead answers the question of what it will have accomplished. It confidently **summarises the argument** you plan to make in the coming long essay (even if at the time of submission you are still exploring several possible directions!), but also **gives an overview of the sources** you will use and the approach you will take. Look to article, dissertation, and book abstracts as the model for this assignment. Use the past tense, not the future tense and write the prospectus as if the long essay is already written and complete. You can find examples of abstracts for academic presentations, for example, in the programs on the websites of annual conferences such as the [AAS (Association of Asian Studies)](http://www.asian-studies.org/Conferences/AAS-Annual-Conference/), the [AHA (American Historical Association)](https://www.historians.org/annual-meeting) meeting or countless other conferences. Article abstracts are another possible model, and are found at the beginning of articles of many journal articles. Most of the articles in the [Journal of Asian Studies](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-asian-studies) and [Modern Asian Studies](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/modern-asian-studies), for example, include an abstract of the article. It is understood that many if not most students will shift their argument or may indeed completely change their topic after the submission of the short essay but this exercise forces you to articulate one possible project with some focus and specificity. The prospectus is an excellent opportunity to test some early ideas you have, or give me an indication of where you are going with your thinking. Due to the very short nature of this assignment, state your topic clearly but **you must include a prospective argument** for your essay. Then write in a bit more detail about in greater depth discussing how you will use certain sources, or what existing historiography you will be engaging with, what new approach you will take or what existing approaches you are hoping to contest, or an introduction to the structure of your essay. 

**Indicative Bibliography**: After the end of your prospectus (the following is not included in the word count) add an *Indicative Bibliography* with three sections: 1) Secondary Sources Already Consulted and Chosen for Use 2) Potential Secondary Sources Still Being Considered for Use 3) Primary Sources Consulted and Chosen for Use 2) Potential Alternative Primary Sources

Questions to consider as you write the short essay:

* Was my short essay written in a coherent and highly focused manner, and avoid distraction or unnecessary information?
* Did I include a concise presentation of what I plan to argue in my coming long essay, even if I'm not yet entirely sure if I can demonstrate the argument?
* Have I situated the essay I am proposing to write in terms of the existing historiography?
* Did I include some reference to the kinds of sources I will be using, or hope to use in making the argument and did I go beyond merely listing them to demonstrate that I have some understanding of why they are useful?
* Did I include a specific concrete example or two illustrating the argument I will be making in the long essay to come?
* Did I write my prospectus in the past tense and write as if the full essay is complete, writing in retrospect about a plausible long essay?

**Short Essay References**: You **do not need to use references** in the prospectus. You can mention key historical texts in the body of the prospectus if you feel it is useful. 

### Long Essay

This **analytical research essay**, which generally should be make use of primary sources, is **worth 50% of the total coursework and should be at least 4,000 words including footnotes. The topic and approach are chosen by yourself but should be related to the country of the module, and be related to the 19th or 20th century, but not necessarily limited to the themes covered in the weeks of the module. Comparative or transnational topics are welcome. **You must set aside several hours a week to make progress on your long essay. This is to allow for the possibility of a need to change topics, to read deeply in the secondary literature to understand the historiography, to survey potential primary sources, to receive inter-library loan requests that were made early in the semester, and allow for writing and rewriting of the essay.

If you select a topic that is comparative (with a similar case in another country) or transnational, the essay may be historiographical in nature and primary sources are optional. Otherwise, you are strongly encouraged to build a long essay that is based on a strong engagement with both primary and secondary sources and any non-comparative non-transnational essay topics not using primary sources need to be approved.

Some class time in most weeks will be dedicated to discussing your progress on your essay. It is not uncommon for a student to change topics once or twice during the semester, as the feasibility of one topic or another is evaluated and the sources explored. My suggestion is that you answer two questions for yourself very early in your research: 1) Once you have a general topic or area of history you are interested in, skim a recent survey work on the broad overarching theme related to your interest to find out what kinds of arguments or historical approaches have been applied to this area before and what kinds of sub-fields and more specialised topics exist within it. This will serve as the starting point to identify your point of intervention. 2) Moving into a more narrow focus and topic, determine What kinds of primary sources will I have realistic access to for use in the essay unless I want to make a purely historiographical essay based exclusively on secondary materials.

### Choosing a Long Essay Topic

Choosing an essay topic and then, having researched this topic, developing a focused argument can be challenging for students who have usually been given an "essay question" in all previous modules. I will provide a few examples of past student long essay titles that gives you some ideas of themes, and also a few first class essays that shows you the variety of kinds of essays that have been written for some of my modules in the past. 

I recommend that you make use of primary historical sources in your essay and develop an argument around them. As you will see, almost all of the first class sample essays are ones which took the challenge of working with primary historical material. Historiographical essays which focus on a particular historical debate about which you develop your own position may also be submitted instead, but such essays are difficult to develop with originality.

**What do I do when I can't think of a topic?** For all students that do not immediately think of a theme, time period, or event they want to focus on for their semester-long work on the long essay, **I strongly encourage** you to browse the primary source list at the end of this handbook and spend a day or two closely examining one or more relevant primary sources or source collections. What strikes you as interesting, curious, ironic, or problematic about these sources? That reaction is very often the beginning of an excellent essay. When you come across that feeling, then look for secondary scholarship on a related theme or the relevant event, person, or organisation that you were looking at, and see what kinds of arguments are already being made about it. Look at recently published articles in leading historical journals: what kinds of sources do they use? How do they build an argument around it?

### Making an Argument

The academic study of history explores change in the past as a way to explore solutions to particular problems. The object of an **analytical historical research essay** is not to tell us simply what happened, but to use what happened in order **to make a historical argument about some problem, clearly defined**. For example, if an essay was written (to take an example from Chinese history) about some aspect of the Boxer Rebellion, it should not consider its task complete when the major facts of the Boxer Rebellion have been retold. That is closer to the genre of the encyclopaedia entry than of academic historical study. It should endeavour to use the Boxer Rebellion as an opportunity to tell us something, to make an argument about a specific problem encompassing some aspect of that event: what does the rebellion reveal about the nature of Western imperialism? The rise of new religious movements in China? The weakness of the late Qing state? The rise of Japan? And so on. The possibilities are many, but in every case, they offer an answer to the question: So what? Why does this history matter? History can and should tell stories, but a research essay embeds a story within an arc of an argument - if it contains narrative elements, it must also always include an analytic element.

The historical argument in your long essays, in particular, **should be clearly and unambiguously stated in the span of 1-3 sentences somewhere in the opening third of the essay, preferably in the opening paragraph or two. It should not be obvious, trivial, or a well-known and rarely contested fact**. Challenging as false an existing historian's argument that has become considered obvious and rarely contested, however, is only one ambitious way to find your way to an interesting and original argument but only if your evidence is sufficient. Alternatively, if you have found evidence that supports the existing arguments of historians in a given area of research in a new set of sources, from a fresh perspective, or in greater depth, or in a comparative light, that also often yields a strong argument. If you have identified a debate in the historiography and wish to take a position on it without simply repeating all of the points made by one of the participants of the debate, that can also yield an essay with a strong argument but you should take care to acknowledge the position and evidence of the other side.

**Presenting your Argument:** There are a number of different ways to write a strong essay and present the argument, but in this module, I would like to strongly encourage you to "front-load" your argument and do so clearly, that is, to present clearly early in the essay what it is you will argue and why it is important. For example, **avoid sentences** such as "I will explain..." or "I aim to understand..." or "I will explore..." unless such sentences are immediately followed by the explanation, what you ended up understanding, or what the result of your exploration was. Otherwise, there is a danger that your essay will merely provide a summary of some quantity of information you have found, rather than present the results of your analysis of that research in a useful way. In other words, **do not use the introduction to make predictions about what you will do, but tell the reader in very clear terms what you *have argued and shown* in the essay**. There are many ways to do this in more or less subtle language but there is no harm in a very clear, "In this essay, I will argue that..." followed by a short overview of what kinds of evidence you will use, how your argument fits into a historiographical context (how your argument relates to what other historians have to say about the matter), and why you think it is important.

For example, this is **not** an argument:

*In this essay, I will explore the relationship between the alarm clock sleep function and our productivity in modern life.*

This is an argument:

*I will argue that the alarm clock sleep function is a major hindrance to our productivity without contributing at all to our rest after a night of sleep. I will base this upon the studies of Hansen and Jenson in 1983 and in a series of interviews with wise old people in 2014. This argument is important because, as I will show, evidence shows that the increased availability of time in the morning to eat a healthier breakfast, carry out some light house chores, and do morning exercise, not only allows for greater evening rest after a long day of work, but decreases the tiredness we feel throughout the day.*

It presents the argument clearly in one sentence, gives a clear indication of how the argument will be carried out, and gives the reader some indication of why the argument matters, that is, why it constitutes an interesting scholarly contribution.

**Sticking to your Argument:** All of us come across many interesting stories, anecdotes, and sub-points that we want to share in writing our essays. However, it is important to stay sharply focused on the argument you are going to make in the essay. After you have finished writing your essay, read it through and for each paragraph and sentence ask yourself if it supported your argument, provided essential background to establishing your argument, or else if it does not offer much of a contribution. If it doesn't, cut it ruthlessly from your essay to make room for better material.

**Engaging with the historiography:** What does this phrase mean? It means directly and explicitly acknowledging what historians have said about your topic and/or your specific question in existing work and then putting your own findings into conversation with them.  Point out both positive contributions and problematic ones when appropriate. Who has worked on this before, and what specifically have they argued? See your essay as part of a larger conversation (it doesn't necessarily have to be an adversarial one) that includes previous historians. Introduce related scholarship early on in your essay, but also as you progress in your argument, noting points where you are reinforcing, tweaking, or contradicting previous scholarship. 

**Important Note on the Historiography: But what if no one or almost no one has written on exactly what I have written about? "The historiography" relevant to your essay *does not mean* only scholarship about the same event, country, or even time period: very often the most useful and rich historiography for you to engage with is found in the form of scholarship on a similar theme but in another place or time.** If you find yourself saying, "No one has written about my topic before," and you have found less than, say, a dozen or more potential secondary works to engage with (though you may not end up using them all), then you have failed to think about the historiography of your topic in sufficiently broad terms. Ask yourself, what broader category is my topic an instance of? Who has made interesting and important contributions on that broader category or theme in the scholarship of other events, places, times? If not only within the historical scholarship, what of other scholars in the humanities and social sciences? You should be able to find at least half a dozen, but ideally a dozen (or more) secondary sources (in addition to primary sources you focus on), with several of these being engaged with directly in the body of the text, not merely cited for evidence.

Some other questions to ask yourself as you write the long essay:

* Does the essay have a clear introduction which articulates the argument I wish to make in the essay? Does it move beyond telling the reader what the essay is "about", avoid the future tense and the helping verb "will", and tell the reader very clearly what *has been accomplished* in the essay and *what is demonstrated* in the essay
* Does the essay avoid introducing new findings or arguments in the conclusion?
* Does the essay have a clear conclusion which restates the main points and then makes some effort to contextualise the findings in the broader issues of the course?
* Does the essay situate the argument being made in the context of the sources used, and its relevance to the study of our module topic?
* Does the essay show a good understanding of the sources used, and use them effectively in supporting my argument with clear and specific examples to enforce my points?
* Does the essay avoid long quotations from secondary works whenever possible? Do I instead summarise, without plagiarising, and cite the work of secondary work except when the particular wording or language is key to the argument I wish to make?
* Have I cited with footnotes all claims that are not a well-known and general historical fact.
* Have I used a variety of appropriate primary sources and secondary sources?
* Have I avoided ever using phrases like "many historians argue" or "much scholarship" or "it is often argued" and replaced all such instances with very specific examples and citations?
* Does the essay retain a strong focus on the main argument, and avoid passages which stray significantly from the main points?
* Does the essay avoid being a summary or introduction to a particular topic, event, or person in order to make a clear argument that is falsifiable?
* Have I gone back and considered my major claims from a critical perspective, and answered any major possible weaknesses in my essay?
* Is my argument non-trivial? That is, does it go beyond a well-known historical consensus about a topic?
* Has the long essay engaged with the historiography on the relevant issue effectively throughout and not merely the introduction?
* Does the essay consider alternative explanations, acknowledge inconvenient facts, and point out sources or historians who may have differing approaches?
* Did I proofread my essay, check the spelling, and reread for sentences that are unclear?
* Did I include page numbers?
* Did I divide primary and secondary sources into separate sections of my bibliography?
* Did I carefully follow the style guide for the School of History or alternatively Chicago Style Notes and Bibliography consistently for all footnotes and bibliography?
* Have I avoided using websites and newspaper articles not by academic authors to support my claims when there are good academic historical scholarship (in monograph, journal article, or online published forms)
* Have I taken care that the background for the argument does not take up too much of the entire length of the essay (less than 25%, usually)
* Did I include a word count in the header and followed the other header guidelines?

### Carrying Out Research for Essays

When you have selected a question or topic for your Long Essay the first, most obvious place to look for information on the topic is among the various books and articles that are assigned or proposed in this course. Early on, it is useful to focus on skimming through sources as you find them, noting carefully works of potential interest found in the footnotes or bibliographies of these works to help you broaden and then later focus in your research. As you find works of interest, make note of the authors and look for other articles or books by the same author, then repeat the process, looking again through the footnotes and bibliography for sources more specifically related to the topic you are researching.

When you do not find enough through the above method of beginning your trail with our existing assigned works, proceed to search in various databases for relevant keywords:

* Our library catalogue
* Major journal databases we have access to such as JSTOR
* Google Scholar (scholar.google.com) which can then direct you to other journals our library may provide access to
* Consult with librarians - they are your friend. Bring them what you have found already and work with them to find further resources.
* Learn to use Google more effectively:
    * Search for phrases in quotation marks " " when appropriate
    * Try adding filetype:pdf to limit results to PDF files
    * You can limit searches to a particular domain or top-level domain, e.g. including: site:st-andrews.ac.uk or site:.edu

The long essays should use at least half a dozen sources which are not websites and the inclusion of primary sources is encouraged but not required. An essay based on sources that are the results of a simple google search can be written in an evening of frantic last minute work, but rarely demonstrates much effort, research skill, or ability to isolate high-quality materials to support an argument. This is not because there are not excellent websites with overviews on a topic, excellent wikipedia entries, etc. but because there is still usually far greater quality material found in published articles and books on most historical topics, including those which are assigned above. It is wise to make use of online research skills to get oriented in a new topic, but use this course as an opportunity to explore the wealth of academic research on your topics. Your essays will be assessed, in part, on how effectively your sources demonstrate your research efforts. Of course, digitized primary (archival sources, documents) or secondary sources (e.g. articles in academic databases) found in digital collection are permitted and an online source or two in addition to your other sources beyond the minimum is fine if chosen carefully for quality.

When you have found a good selection of a dozen or two sources through a process of skimming of footnotes and bibliographies etc., start your more detailed reading with something of broader coverage to give you some ideas of potential specific arguments or hypotheses. Then move swiftly and with more focus to search through the other sources in the specific sections that are likely to show whether your potential argument holds or not. In researching for an essay you rarely have to read an entire work, and even when you do so, you should skim less relevant sections. Unlike reading for pleasure, historical research involves reading as a hunt for answers to problems. If you find that your argument does not hold or has insufficient evidence to support it, zoom out again and restart the process.

This circular movement is one very effective approach to historical research. Start broad, find potential key arguments and inspiring ideas. Moving quickly, test these ideas and arguments by searching in other sources and zooming into detailed cases and examples. If this doesn't work or is insufficient, zoom out again and repeat. Once you are happy with an argument and the available evidence, then read more slowly and with determination, taking more detailed notes, and outlining your essay as you go.

**The Worst Possible Way to Proceed:** Perhaps the worst possible way to do research for your essay is to find a dozen or two works on your broad topic by title search. This usually results in you finding several very general and introductory works on your topic. It will also often mean that you end up with several books or articles that are decades old and don't reflect more recent debates. You are also lulled into the confident state of mind that "I have enough material" only to discover after weeks of procrastination that only a fragment of your pile of promisingly titled works are relevant to your specific argument. Instead think of using a spiral motion: reading one recent survey, scrape the footnotes and bibliography for interesting related works (often not only related to the exact place, event, or period of your theme), and then move out (reading more broadly in the theme) and in (moving more deeply in the primary sources and close empirical literature) several times throughout the semester.

### How your Long Essay is Evaluated

The points that follow should be fairly clear from the questions posed above but are restated from the perspective of the marker of a very strong long essay:

- The essay gives a clear presentation of its argument in the introduction of the essay
- The essay is written well and has a clear structure.
- The argument is well signposted, with different sub-arguments of the essay clearly introduced with clear topical sentences.
- The essay shows that extensive reading and research was done in order to write this essay in the secondary and primary source literature.
- The School of History Style Guide was carefully followed.
- A well-formatted bibliography is provided showing that research was carried out using sources of an appropriate quality and number, including at least half a dozen secondary sources (more likely to be a dozen or more).
- The essay consistently cites its sources with footnotes
- This essay employs evidence based on its sources in an effective manner.
- Unless it is a historiographical essay, the essay works with primary sources which make a substantive contribution to its main argument.
- The essay engages with the relevant historiography on this topic directly and effectively throughout
- The essay has a good balance between empirical examples and presenting evidence on the one hand, and strong analysis contributing to the argument on the other
- The argument of the essay is not trivial, overly general, or merely represent a summary of the widely recognized academic consensus on a given topic

### Online Submission

Unless otherwise indicated, work will considered submitted by the date the document was submitted online on the MMS. Paper copies do not need to be submitted: let's save paper. If you are concerned that any given assignment was not correctly submitted to the MMS, you are free to email a copy of your submitted assignment, if you like. In the event an assignment was not correctly uploaded to the MMS for some reason, but an emailed copy was sent in time, that date of submission will be used, but a copy will still need to be submitted to the MMS thereafter.

### Feedback

Feedback is generally provided directly on the mark sheet, which will be posted to the MMS within 10 work days (2 weeks). Presentations, however, are marked in bundles with feedback out by the end of week 5 and week 11. Depending on assignment, there may be additional feedback provided in the margins of the original essay. If that is the case, you will find two files uploaded with your mark.

### Presentation

The short assessed presentation should be 5 minutes in length and not a minute longer. Presentations over 5 minutes will be penalised. Presentation sign-up will happen in week one. You may switch weeks if you find someone to switch with. If there are multiple people signed up for a week (maximum of two), it is your responsibility to get the contact information of the other person, contact them, and ensure that you are not presenting on the same work. You have two choices for your presentation. Choose one of the following:

* If the required reading includes a book that is not an edited volume, you may present on the entire book. In this case, your presentation *should assume* everyone has read the required parts of the book, but a brief summary of any unassigned portions of the book should be either included in the presentation, or provided on the handout. The bulk of the presentation should be a presentation of your evaluation of the book, one or more of its main arguments, and may optionally consider its main argument in connection with some relevant other work in the historiography.
* Instead, when available for the appropriate week, you may choose to present on a book that is not an edited volume from the further reading. A (P) is found next to recommended choices in the further reading. **Important: Not all further reading texts are in the library yet, please check this at the beginning of the semester so that they can be ordered if necessary through inter-library loan**

Whichever you choose, the presentation should briefly summarise the main arguments, point out what was most interesting or useful as a takeaway from the text, and make 1-3 focused critiques or observations about the read material. You must not present a detailed summary of the content: instead it should highlight the arguments, strengths and only briefly set the context. 

A supplementary handout (one piece of paper front and back at most) should be uploaded to MMS and copies for everyone brought that includes some bullet points that may include arguments, interesting empirical examples, key quotes, any interesting sources used, or highlight key persons or dates. **Important: The handout is not an outline of your presentation and should under no circumstances be read from. It should be a useful reference about the reading.** The bullet points should be complete sentences (describing an argument or concrete point), not merely short phrases representing vague topics in an outline form. If you are presenting on a book from the required reading, try to make your handout as useful as possible for possible review for the examination. Please bring copies of the handout to class but also add (or link) the handout text to the class collaborative notes document. Outside research is not required. There are no slides for the presentation.

Feedback for presentations will be sent at two moments during semester, rather than on a rolling basis, once around half way through the semester, and the second batch at the end of the semester.

Some questions to consider as you prepare:

* Did I upload my handout to MMS presentation section before giving my presentation?
* Did I bring printed copies of the handout to class?
* Did the distributed handout of one or at most two sides of a piece of paper accurately summarize the general points to be made in the presentation in the form of concise bullet points
* Did the handout include any important dates, sources, or, when useful, a map that serves as a useful reference?
* Was the 5 minute limit very strictly observed in the presentation?
* Did the presentation briefly provide the context of the work, and introduce the author very briefly?
* Was the presentation well structured, organized, and focus on a only few key points?
* Was there a good balance of arguments, examples to support them, and critique?
* Did the presentation avoid being a presentation of a series of bullet-point style facts?
* Did the presentation make an effort to connect the readings to other readings for the day when appropriate or find ways to connect to the reading and discussion from previous weeks?
* Did you maintain good eye contact with your fellow students (not only with the tutor) throughout?
* Did you present in an audible, clear, and clearly articulated fashion that was not monotone or sound like it was being read?
