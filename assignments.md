## Assignments

The assessed portion of the coursework for this module consists of one essay, a presentation, and three short essays responding to weekly discussion questions. In addition, students are required to come prepared each week having completed the assigned reading and prepared to discuss them.

### Long Essay

The essay for the course is worth 30% of the total grade and should be between 4,000-4,500 words. The process of composing an essay of this length is made far easier if make steady progress throughout the semester rather than face potential panic and disappointment nearer the deadline. Narrow down an area of interest, read within this area of interest, isolate a few questions of interest, carry out further reading and analysis, and then proceed to write an essay which makes a convincing historical argument. 

Some class time on week three will be dedicated to discussing the essay. At that time, please send me two or three general potential topics of interest that are related to the Japanese empire, the name of one or two secondary or primary historical works related to each, and a brief note as to why you chose that work. I will give feedback on the ideas, and throughout the semester encourage students to visit me in office hours to help discuss the move from general topics of interest to specific historical questions. I am also willing to look at an outline of your essay and your final list of sources.

### Making an Argument

The academic study of history embraces change in the past as a way to explore solutions to particular problems. The object of a historical research essay is not to tell us simply what happened, but to use what happened in order to make a historical argument about some problem clearly defined. For example, if an essay is written about some aspect of the Boxer Rebellion, it should not consider its task complete when the major facts of the Boxer Rebellion have been retold. That is closer to the genre of the encyclopaedia entry than of academic historical study. It should endeavour to use the Boxer Rebellion as an opportunity to tell us something, to make an argument about something: what does the rebellion reveal about the nature of Western imperialism? The rise of new religious movements in China? The weakness of the late Qing state? The rise of Japan? And so on. The possibilities are many, but in every case, they offer an answer to the question: So what? Why does this history matter? History can and should tell stories, but a research essay embeds a story within an arc of an argument - if it contains narrative elements, it must also always include an analytic element.

The historical argument in your long essays, in particular, should be clearly and unambiguously stated in the span of 1-3 sentences somewhere in the opening third of the essay, preferably in the opening paragraph or two. If you are answering one of the questions rather than choosing one of the broader topics, this can usually be accomplished by giving a clear answer and adding at least some detail about how you will go on to support your answer. Your argument should be falsifiable, that is, it should be possible to meaningfully contradict the argument you make and demonstrate that it is false if the presented evidence is not sufficient or poorly deployed. It should not be obvious, trivial, or a well-known and rarely contested fact. Challenging as false an existing historian's argument that has become considered obvious and rarely contested, however, is one ambitious way to find your way to an interesting and original argument but only if your evidence is sufficient. Alternatively, if you have found evidence that supports the existing arguments of historians in a given area of research in a new set of sources, from a fresh perspective, or in greater depth, or in a comparative light, that also often yields a strong argument. If you have identified a debate in the historiography and wish to take a position on it without simply repeating all of the points made by one of the participants of the debate, that can also yield an essay with a strong argument but you should take care to acknowledge the position and evidence of the other side.

Some questions to ask yourself as you write the long essay:

* Does the essay have a clear introduction which articulates the argument I wish to make in the essay?
* Does the essay have a clear conclusion which restates the main points?
* Does the essay situate the argument being made in the context of the sources used, and its relevance to the study of Japanese imperialism (the "so what" question)? 
* Does the essay show a good understanding of the sources used, and use them effectively in supporting my argument?
* Does the essay avoid long quotations from secondary works whenever possible?
* Have I used a variety of appropriate sources?
* Did I make connections between my essay and the readings and discussions througout the semester in the module?
* Does the essay retain a strong focus on the main argument, and avoid passages which stray significantly from the main points?
* Does the essay avoid being a summary or introduction to a particular topic, event, or person in order to make a clear argument that is falsifiable?
* Does the essay consider alternative explanations, acknowledge inconvenient facts, and point out sources or historians who may have differing approaches?

### Carrying Out Research for Essays

When you have selected a topic for your longer essay the first, most obvious place to look for information on the topic is among the various books and articles that are assigned or proposed in this course. Early on, it is useful to focus on skimming through sources as you find them, noting carefully works of potential interest found in the footnotes or bibliographies of these works to help you broaden and then later focus in your research. As you find works of interest, make note of the authors and look for other articles or books by the same author, then repeat the process, looking again through the footnotes and bibliography for sources more specifically related to the topic you are researching.

When you do not find enough through the above method of beginning your trail with our existing assigned works, proceed to search in various databases for relevant keywords:

* Our library catalogue 
* Major journal databases we have access to such as JSTOR
* Google Scholar (scholar.google.com) which can then direct you to other journals our library may provide access to
* Consult with librarians - they are your friend. Bring them what you have found already and work with them to find further resources.
* Learn to use Google more effectively:
    * Search for phrases in quotation marks " " when appropriate
    * Try adding filetype:pdf to limit results to PDF files
    * You can limit searches to a particular domain or top-level domain, e.g. including: site:st-andrews.ac.uk or site:.edu 

The long essays should use at least half a dozen sources which are not websites and the inclusion of primary sources is strongly encouraged except in the case of an explicitly historiographical essay. An essay based on sources that are the results of a simple google search can be written in an evening or two of frantic last minute work, but rarely demonstrates much effort, research skill, or ability to isolate high-quality materials to support an argument. This is not because there are not excellent websites with overviews on a topic, excellent wikipedia entries, etc. but because there is still usually far greater quality material found in published articles and books on most historical topics, including those which are assigned above. It is wise to make use of online research skills to get oriented in a new topic, but use this course as an opportunity to explore the wealth of academic research on your topics. Your essays will be assessed, in part, on how effectively your sources demonstrate your research efforts. Of course, digitized primary (archival sources, documents) or secondary sources (e.g. articles in academic databases) found in digital collection are permitted and an online source or two in addition to your other sources beyond the minimum is fine if chosen carefully for quality. 

When you have found a good selection of a dozen or two sources through a process of skimming of footnotes and bibliographies etc., start your more detailed reading with something of broader coverage to give you some ideas of potential specific arguments or hypotheses. Then move swiftly and with more focus to search through the other sources in the specific sections that are likely to show whether your potential argument holds or not. In researching for an essay you rarely have to read an entire work, and even when you do so, you should skim less relevant sections. Unlike reading for pleasure, historical research involves reading as a hunt for answers to problems. If you find that your argument does not hold or has insufficient evidence to support it, zoom out again and restart the process. 

This circular movement is one very effective approach to historical research. Start broad, find potential key arguments and inspiring ideas. Moving quickly, test these ideas and arguments by searching in other sources and zooming into detailed cases and examples. If this doesn't work or is insufficient, zoom out again and repeat. Once you are happy with an argument and the available evidence, then read more slowly and with determination, taking more detailed notes, and outlining your essay as you go.

**The Worst Possible Way to Proceed:** Perhaps the worst possible way to do research for your essay is to find a dozen or two works on your broad topic by title search. This usually results in you finding several very general and introductory works on your topic. Allow this collection of books and articles to rest comfortably on your shelf until the deadline nears, and then sit down and attempt to read all these works and hope that your essay will emerge from the vast knowledge you have gained in reading these books. 

### Headers and Formatting

At the top of your written work, please include:

* The date of submission
* The assignment you are submitting (e.g. Short Essay 1, Long Essay, etc.)
* Your student number
* A title, when appropriate
* The total number of words (use the word count feature of your word processor)

When formatting your assignments, please follow these guidelines:

* Add page numbers
* Use a minimum of 12 sized font
* Use a serif (such as Times Roman, Georgia, Garamond), not a sans serif font (such as Arial, Helvetica, Verdana)
* Please double space your essays

Other aspects of formatting are highlighted in the School of History style sheet. See the following section.

### Footnotes and References

Please carefully read the St Andrews School of History Style Sheet:

http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/history/infoug/stylesheet.html

This document, sections 1-4, contains extremely valuable information on how to compose your essay, including how to format your footnotes and bibliography. In particular, please follow the instructions for footnotes carefully.

### Online Submission

Unless otherwise indicated, work will considered submitted by the date the document was submitted online on the MMS. The digital submission is the only submission that matters for the mark. Paper copies of your submissions are requested and may be submitted in class or directly to my box on the first floor of St Katharine's Lodge. 

If you are concerned that any given assignment was not correctly submitted to the MMS, you are free to email a copy of your submitted assignment, if you like. In the event an assignment was not correctly uploaded to the MMS for some reason, but an emailed copy was sent in time, that date of submission will be used, but a copy will still need to be submitted to the MMS thereafter.

### Extensions and Late Work

Prior permissions for late submission of work ("Extensions") to make fair allowance for adverse circumstances affecting a student's ability to submit the work on time will be considered on a case by case basis. Normally such permissions will only be granted for circumstances that are both unforeseen and beyond the student's control.

Without an approved extension, 0.5 points will be deducted for every day (including Saturday, Sunday, and any holiday) after the relevant deadline.

Work submitted more than two weeks after the relevant deadline but before the School's final deadline for semester work will receive an automatic fail mark of 1.

### Word Limits

Assessed work with word limits should be always submitted within those limits. Writing in a clear and concise manner, and being able to structure and execute an argument that may be shorter than you feel is required is a skill that is of great use in academic fields as well as the workplace beyond. A piece of work that is under 10% over the limit will not be penalised. Work that ranges around 10-20% too long, will be penalised by 1 point. Anything above 20% of the word limit the work will be returned unmarked. Once resubmitted the piece of work will be marked and late submission penalties apply. 

### Feedback

General feedback is provided directly on the mark sheet, which will usually be posted to the MMS within 10 weekdays (2 weeks). Additional feedback, especially for longer essays is sometimes available on an annotated copy of your submitted work, usually return via MMS. Occasionally, feedback is written on a paper copy of the assigned work, which will usually be returned after the mark has already been posted to MMS.

### Presentation

Most weeks of the semester students will be given and opportunity to present a summary, critique, and raise some discussion questions based on supplementary readings. One such presentation for each student will be given more time and assessed formally. The assessed presentation should be 15-20 minutes in length and not longer. It may either focus on one or two books, or a collection of articles (3 articles to replace a book) from among the assigned required or supplementary readings for each week. It should summarise the main arguments, and make 1-3 to focused critiques or observations about the read material. A supplementary handout (1-2 pages at most) should be brought that includes some bullet points from the summary, any key persons or dates, and a few questions about the themes in the reading to kick off our discussion.

Occasionally, there will also be non-assessed presentations that students will be asked to volunteer for in some weeks that are shorter (5-10 minutes) and do not require a handout to be prepared (though they are welcome).

Some questions to consider as you prepare:

* Did the distributed handout of one or at most two pages accurately summarize the general points to be made in the presentation in the form of concise bullet points
* If appropriate, did the handout include any important dates, sources, or a map for the discussion?
* Did the handout include 1-3 discussion questions?
* Was the 20 minute limit strictly observed in the presentation?
* Was the presentation well structured, organized, and focus on a few key points?
* Was there a good balance of arguments and a few examples to support them?

### Short Essays

There are three short essays for this course which should be between 500-700 words in length, not including footnotes. They are designed to help you in preparation for your longer essay and may take one of two forms:

1. **Critical Review:** You may write a critical review of one secondary or primary source in the form of a book that you have selected to help you write your long essay. In it you should state clearly and briefly what the book argues and what you have extracted from it that will help you make the argument in your longer essay. It should also include at least a few sentences with your evaluation of the such as whether it is particularly effective or problematic as a source. Include a full reference for the book at the top and you may make reference to page numbers within by means of simple page numbers in parentheses.

2. **Prospectus:** Alternatively, you may write a short essay that summarises the argument you plan to make in the coming long essay, or are exploring at the moment for your longer essay. This is an excellent opportunity to test some early ideas you have, or give me an indication of where you are going with your thinking. Due to the very short nature of this assignment, state your topic broadly, then write in a bit more detail about one or two specific examples of what you will be arguing in greater depth in your long essay to come. This exercise can be very helpful to you in processing your thinking about the long essay, and giving me an opportunity to offer feedback along the way.

You may decide to write any combination of these approaches, but a common approach will be to write two critical reviews and one prospectus. Please indicate at the top of your short essay which you are selecting. If you change topic during the semester, writing a new prospectus for your new topic is a good way to make the adjustment and give me an opportunity to provide feedback on your new topic.

Questions to consider as you write the short essay:

* Was my short essay written in a coherent and highly focused manner, and avoid distraction or unnecessary information?
* If I am writing a critical review, did I include a concise overview of what the source is about?
* If I am writing a critical review, did I tie the arguments of the book to where I hope to go in the argument for my longer essay?
* If I am writing a critical review, did I include an evaluation of the work with a specific example of its strong and/or problematic aspects?
* If I am writing a prospectus, did I include a concise presentation of what I plan to argue in my coming long essay?
* If I am writing a prospectus, did I include a specific example or two illustrating the argument I will be making in the long essay to come?
