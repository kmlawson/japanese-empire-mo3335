## Assignments

The assessed portion of the coursework for this module consists of one long essay, a presentation, and two short essays. In addition, students are required to come prepared each week having completed the assigned reading and ready to discuss them.

### Short Essays

There are two short essays for this course which should be between 500-800 words in length, including any footnotes. They are designed to help you in preparation for your longer essay and may take one of two forms:

1. **Critical Review:** You may write a critical review of one secondary or primary source in the form of a book that you have selected to help you write your long essay. In it you should state clearly and briefly what the book argues and what you have extracted from it that will help you make the argument in your longer essay. Your critical review should include your evaluation of the source. What are its strong points? Where does it fall short? Include a full reference for the book at the top and you may make reference to page numbers within by means of simple page numbers in parentheses. 

2. **Prospectus:** Alternatively, you may write a short essay that summarises the argument you plan to make in the coming long essay, or are exploring at the moment for your longer essay. Look to article, dissertation, and book abstracts as the model for this assignment. This is an excellent opportunity to test some early ideas you have, or give me an indication of where you are going with your thinking. Due to the very short nature of this assignment, state your topic broadly, then write in a bit more detail about one or two specific examples of what you will be arguing in greater depth in your long essay to come. This exercise can be very helpful to you in processing your thinking about the long essay, and giving me an opportunity to offer feedback along the way.

You may decide to write one of each of these, or two of either. Please indicate at the top of your short essay which you are selecting. If you change topic during the semester, making both short essays a prospectus is a good way to make the adjustment and give me an opportunity to provide feedback on your new topic.

Questions to consider as you write the short essay:

* Was my short essay written in a coherent and highly focused manner, and avoid distraction or unnecessary information?
* If I am writing a critical review, did I include a concise overview of what the source is about?
* If I am writing a critical review, did I tie the arguments of the book to where I hope to go in the argument for my longer essay?
* If I am writing a critical review, did I include an evaluation of the work with a specific example of its strong and/or problematic aspects?
* If I am writing a prospectus, did I include a concise presentation of what I plan to argue in my coming long essay, even if I'm not yet entirely sure if I can demonstrate the argument?
* If I am writing a prospectus, did I include some reference to the kinds of sources I will be using, or hope to use in making the argument?
* If I am writing a prospectus, did I include a specific example or two illustrating the argument I will be making in the long essay to come?

### Long Essay

The essay for the course is worth 50% of the total coursework and has a limit of 5,000 words including footnotes. The process of composing an essay of this length is made far easier if you make steady progress throughout the semester rather than face potential panic and disappointment nearer the deadline. Narrow down an area of interest, read within this area of interest, isolate a few questions of interest, carry out further reading and analysis, and then proceed to write an essay which makes a convincing historical argument. 

Some class time in week four will be dedicated to discussing the essay. At that time, please send me two or three general potential topics of interest that are related to our module, the name of one or two secondary or primary historical works related to each, and a brief note as to why you chose that work. I will give feedback on the ideas, and throughout the semester encourage students to visit me in office hours to help discuss the move from general topics of interest to specific historical questions. I am also willing to look at an outline of your essay and your final list of sources.

### Making an Argument

The academic study of history embraces change in the past as a way to explore solutions to particular problems. The object of an analytical historical research essay is not to tell us simply what happened, but to use what happened in order to make a historical argument about some problem clearly defined. For example, if an essay was written (to take an example from Chinese history) about some aspect of the Boxer Rebellion, it should not consider its task complete when the major facts of the Boxer Rebellion have been retold. That is closer to the genre of the encyclopaedia entry than of academic historical study. It should endeavour to use the Boxer Rebellion as an opportunity to tell us something, to make an argument about something: what does the rebellion reveal about the nature of Western imperialism? The rise of new religious movements in China? The weakness of the late Qing state? The rise of Japan? And so on. The possibilities are many, but in every case, they offer an answer to the question: So what? Why does this history matter? History can and should tell stories, but a research essay embeds a story within an arc of an argument - if it contains narrative elements, it must also always include an analytic element.

The historical argument in your long essays, in particular, should be clearly and unambiguously stated in the span of 1-3 sentences somewhere in the opening third of the essay, preferably in the opening paragraph or two. If you are answering one of the questions rather than choosing one of the broader topics, this can usually be accomplished by giving a clear answer and adding at least some detail about how you will go on to support your answer. Your argument should be falsifiable, that is, it should be possible to meaningfully contradict the argument you make and demonstrate that it is false if the presented evidence is not sufficient or poorly deployed. It should not be obvious, trivial, or a well-known and rarely contested fact. Challenging as false an existing historian's argument that has become considered obvious and rarely contested, however, is one ambitious way to find your way to an interesting and original argument but only if your evidence is sufficient. Alternatively, if you have found evidence that supports the existing arguments of historians in a given area of research in a new set of sources, from a fresh perspective, or in greater depth, or in a comparative light, that also often yields a strong argument. If you have identified a debate in the historiography and wish to take a position on it without simply repeating all of the points made by one of the participants of the debate, that can also yield an essay with a strong argument but you should take care to acknowledge the position and evidence of the other side.

**Presenting your Argument:** There are a number of different ways to write a strong essay and present the argument, but in this module, I would like to strongly encourage you to "front-load" your argument and do so clearly, that is, to present clearly early in the essay what it is you will argue and why it is important. For example, avoid sentences such as "I will explain..." or "I aim to understand..." or "I will explore..." unless these are immediately followed by the explanation, what you ended up understanding, or what the result of your exploration was. In other words, do not use the introduction to make predictions about what you will do, but tell the reader in very clear terms what you **have argued and shown** in the essay. There are many ways to do this in more or less subtle language but there is no harm in a very clear, "In this essay, I will argue that..." followed by a short overview of what kinds of evidence you will use, how your argument fits into a historiographical context (how your argument relates to what other historians have to say about the matter), and why you think it is important. 

For example replace:

In this essay, I will explore the relationship between the alarm clock sleep function and our productivity in modern life.

with something like:

I will argue that the alarm clock sleep function is a major hindrance to our productivity without contributing at all to our rest after a night of sleep. I will base this upon the studies of Hansen and Jenson in 1983 and in a series of interviews with wise old people in 2014. This argument is important because, as I will show, evidence shows that the increased availability of time in the morning to eat a healthier breakfast, carry out some light house chores, and do morning exercise, not only allows for greater evening rest after a long day of work, but decreases the tiredness we feel throughout the day.

**Sticking to your Argument:** All of us come across many interesting stories, anecdotes, and sub-points that we want to share in writing our essays. However, it is important to stay sharply focused on the argument you are going to make in the essay. After you have finished writing your essay, read it through and for each paragraph and sentence ask yourself if it supported your argument, provided essential background to establishing your argument, or else if it does not offer much of a contribution. If it doesn't, cut it ruthlessly from your essay to make room for better material.

Some other questions to ask yourself as you write the long essay:

* Does the essay have a clear introduction which articulates the argument I wish to make in the essay?
* Does the essay have a clear conclusion which restates the main points and then makes some effort to contextualise the findings in the broader issues of the course?
* Does the essay situate the argument being made in the context of the sources used, and its relevance to the study of our module topic?
* Does the essay show a good understanding of the sources used, and use them effectively in supporting my argument with clear and specific examples to enforce my points?
* Does the essay avoid long quotations from secondary works whenever possible?
* Have I been careful not to plagiarise sources and cite them whenever used?
* Have I cited with footnotes all claims that are not a well-known and general historical fact.
* Have I used a variety of appropriate sources?
* Does the essay retain a strong focus on the main argument, and avoid passages which stray significantly from the main points?
* Does the essay avoid being a summary or introduction to a particular topic, event, or person in order to make a clear argument that is falsifiable?
* Does the essay consider alternative explanations, acknowledge inconvenient facts, and point out sources or historians who may have differing approaches?
* Did I proofread my essay, check the spelling, and reread for sentences that are unclear?
* Did I carefully follow the style guide for the School of History for all my footnotes?
* Did I include a bibliography at the end of my essay and is it formatted according to the School of History style guide?
* Have I avoided using websites and newspaper articles not by academic authors to support my claims when there are good academic historical scholarship (in monograph, journal article, or online published forms)
* Have I taken care that the background for the argument does not take up too much of the entire length of the essay (less than 25%, usually)
* Did I include a word count in the header and followed the other header guidelines?
* Did I follow the formatting guidelines below?

### Carrying Out Research for Essays

When you have selected a question or topic for your longer essay the first, most obvious place to look for information on the topic is among the various books and articles that are assigned or proposed in this course. Early on, it is useful to focus on skimming through sources as you find them, noting carefully works of potential interest found in the footnotes or bibliographies of these works to help you broaden and then later focus in your research. As you find works of interest, make note of the authors and look for other articles or books by the same author, then repeat the process, looking again through the footnotes and bibliography for sources more specifically related to the topic you are researching.

When you do not find enough through the above method of beginning your trail with our existing assigned works, proceed to search in various databases for relevant keywords:

* Our library catalogue 
* Major journal databases we have access to such as JSTOR
* Google Scholar (scholar.google.com) which can then direct you to other journals our library may provide access to
* Consult with librarians - they are your friend. Bring them what you have found already and work with them to find further resources.
* Learn to use Google more effectively:
    * Search for phrases in quotation marks " " when appropriate
    * Try adding filetype:pdf to limit results to PDF files
    * You can limit searches to a particular domain or top-level domain, e.g. including: site:st-andrews.ac.uk or site:.edu 

The long essays should use at least half a dozen sources which are not websites and the inclusion of primary sources is encouraged but not required. An essay based on sources that are the results of a simple google search can be written in an evening of frantic last minute work, but rarely demonstrates much effort, research skill, or ability to isolate high-quality materials to support an argument. This is not because there are not excellent websites with overviews on a topic, excellent wikipedia entries, etc. but because there is still usually far greater quality material found in published articles and books on most historical topics, including those which are assigned above. It is wise to make use of online research skills to get oriented in a new topic, but use this course as an opportunity to explore the wealth of academic research on your topics. Your essays will be assessed, in part, on how effectively your sources demonstrate your research efforts. Of course, digitized primary (archival sources, documents) or secondary sources (e.g. articles in academic databases) found in digital collection are permitted and an online source or two in addition to your other sources beyond the minimum is fine if chosen carefully for quality. 

When you have found a good selection of a dozen or two sources through a process of skimming of footnotes and bibliographies etc., start your more detailed reading with something of broader coverage to give you some ideas of potential specific arguments or hypotheses. Then move swiftly and with more focus to search through the other sources in the specific sections that are likely to show whether your potential argument holds or not. In researching for an essay you rarely have to read an entire work, and even when you do so, you should skim less relevant sections. Unlike reading for pleasure, historical research involves reading as a hunt for answers to problems. If you find that your argument does not hold or has insufficient evidence to support it, zoom out again and restart the process. 

This circular movement is one very effective approach to historical research. Start broad, find potential key arguments and inspiring ideas. Moving quickly, test these ideas and arguments by searching in other sources and zooming into detailed cases and examples. If this doesn't work or is insufficient, zoom out again and repeat. Once you are happy with an argument and the available evidence, then read more slowly and with determination, taking more detailed notes, and outlining your essay as you go.

**The Worst Possible Way to Proceed:** Perhaps the worst possible way to do research for your essay is to find a dozen or two works on your broad topic by title search. This usually results in you finding several very general and introductory works on your topic. Allow this collection of books and articles to rest comfortably on your shelf until the deadline nears, and then sit down and attempt to read all these works and hope that your essay will emerge from the vast knowledge you have gained in reading these books. 

### Headers and Formatting

At the top of your written work, please include:

* The date of submission
* The assignment you are submitting (e.g. Short Essay 1, Long Essay, etc.)
* Your student number
* A title, when appropriate
* The total number of words (use the word count feature of your word processor)

When formatting your assignments, please follow these guidelines:

* Add page numbers
* Use a minimum of 12 sized font
* Use a serif (such as Times Roman, Georgia, Garamond), not a sans serif font (such as Arial, Helvetica, Verdana)
* Please double space your essays

Other aspects of formatting are highlighted in the School of History style sheet. See the following section.

### Footnotes and References

Please carefully read the St Andrews School of History Style Sheet:

http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/history/infoug/stylesheet.html

This document, sections 1-4, contains extremely valuable information on how to compose your essay, including how to format your footnotes and bibliography. In particular, please follow the instructions for footnotes carefully.

### How your Long Essay is Evaluated

Here are some of the features of a superb long essay that I look for as I mark your work:

- The essay gives a clear presentation of its argument in the introduction of the essay
- The essay is written well and has a clear structure. 
- The essay is within the word limit and of a sufficient length for its proposed scope.
- The argument is well signposted, with different sub-arguments of the essay clearly introduced with clear topical sentences. 
- The essay shows that extensive reading and research was done in order to write this essay. 
- A well-formatted bibliography is provided showing that research was carried out using sources of an appropriate quality and number.
- Evidence is well cited in the footnotes and the footnotes are generally formatted well. 
- This essay employs evidence based on its sources in an effective manner.
- Unless it is a historiographical essay, the essay works with primary sources which make a substantive contribution to its main argument.
- The essay engages with the relevant historiography on this topic directly and effectively
- The essay has a good balance of empirical examples and evidence on the one hand, and strong analysis contributing to the argument on the other
- The argument of the essay is not trivial, overly general, or merely represent a summary of the widely recognized academic consensus on a given topic

### Online Submission

Unless otherwise indicated, work will considered submitted by the date the document was submitted online on the MMS. The digital submission is the only submission that matters for the mark. Paper copies of your submissions are requested and may be submitted in class or directly to my box on the first floor of St Katharine's Lodge. 

If you are concerned that any given assignment was not correctly submitted to the MMS, you are free to email a copy of your submitted assignment, if you like. In the event an assignment was not correctly uploaded to the MMS for some reason, but an emailed copy was sent in time, that date of submission will be used, but a copy will still need to be submitted to the MMS thereafter.

### Extensions and Late Work

Prior permissions for late submission of work ("Extensions") to make fair allowance for adverse circumstances affecting a student's ability to submit the work on time will be considered on a case by case basis. Normally such permissions will only be granted for circumstances that are both unforeseen and beyond the student's control.

This module follows the official School of History penalties for late work:

http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/history/infoug/penalties%20for%20late%20work.html

### Word Limits

Assessed work with word limits should be always submitted within those limits. Writing in a clear and concise manner, and being able to structure and execute an argument that may be shorter than you feel is required is a skill that is of great use in academic fields as well as the workplace beyond. Please do not go over the limit and force yourself to work within them as a practice that will be important for writing assignments in your future careers. 

The official School of Histories penalties for short/long work are followed in this module:

http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/history/infoug/penalties%20for%20late%20work.html

### Feedback

General feedback is provided directly on the mark sheet, which will be posted to the MMS within 10 weekdays (2 weeks). Additional feedback, especially for longer essays is sometimes available on an annotated copy of your submitted work, usually return via MMS. Occasionally, feedback is written on a paper copy of the assigned work, which will usually be returned after the mark has already been posted to MMS.

### Presentation

Most weeks of the semester students will be given and opportunity to present a summary, critique, and raise some discussion questions based on supplementary readings. One such presentation for each student will be given more time and assessed formally. The assessed presentation should be 15 minutes in length and not longer. It may either focus on one book, a secondary source, or a collection of articles (3 articles or so) from among the supplementary readings for each week, or may focus on any part of the texts and primary sources among the required readings from beyond the page limits assigned. For example, if we read a part of a book for a week, the presentation can present the book as a whole. It should summarise the main arguments, and make 1-3 to focused critiques or observations about the read material. A supplementary handout (1-2 pages at most) should be brought that includes some bullet points from the summary, any key persons or dates, and, optionally a question to kick off our discussion. The presentations should ideally focus on connecting what is read and presented to our existing readings and the discussion of the day. Connecting the reading to past readings and discussions in the module is also a very welcome.

Please note, when discussion questions have been provided in advance on a topic, the presentation need not provide any answer to these, though the presentation may raise points that are a relevant contribution to those questions. The new discussion questions by the student should try not to repeat or significantly overlap with any previously supplied discussion questions.

Occasionally, there will also be non-assessed presentations that students will be asked to volunteer for in some weeks that are shorter (5-10 minutes) and do not require a handout to be prepared (though they are welcome).

Feedback for presentations will be sent to multiple students at two or three points during the semester, rather than on a rolling basis.

Some questions to consider as you prepare:

* Did the distributed handout of one or at most two pages accurately summarize the general points to be made in the presentation in the form of concise bullet points
* If appropriate, did the handout include any important dates, sources, or a map for the discussion?
* Did the handout include a discussion question?
* Was the 15 minute limit strictly observed in the presentation?
* Was the presentation well structured, organized, and focus on a only few key points?
* Was there a good balance of arguments and a few examples to support them?
* Did the presentation avoid being a presentation of a series of bullet-point style facts?
* Did the presentation make an effort to connect to the required readings for the day or find ways to connect to the reading and discussion from previous weeks?
