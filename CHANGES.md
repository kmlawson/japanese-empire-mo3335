# Changes

Here I list some of the significant changes in this module over the years, after the module was first offered spring of 2014.

## Fall 2015

* reduced the total amount of reading from an average of 250 pages to 200 pages or less per week average of required reading. 
* replaced one themed week with a consolidation week allowing students more time to work on the long essay
* added a lot more detail from week to week on preparation and overview
* made shorter presentations a more regular thing
* refined the long presentation to focus more on assigned materials
* added cover page with image
* removed week on occupied Japan in order to make space for the consolidation week focusing on preparation for the Long Essay. This will be used for pair writing and discussion.
* added "reference" file with standard university policies and links to more details about them
* consolidated the "student of empire" week with the "entering the world stage" week in order to make room for:
* added a focused week on "Settler Colonialism and migration in the Empire"
* Consolidated two of the colonialism weeks in order to make room for a new week on:
* added a week on "Imperial innovation in Manchuria"
* made adjustments to the assigned readings throughout all weeks
