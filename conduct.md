# Academic Misconduct and Plagiarism

Academic integrity is fundamental to the values promoted by the University. It is important that all students are judged on their ability, and that no student is allowed unfairly to take an advantage over others, to affect the security and integrity of the assessment process, or to diminish the reliability and quality of a St Andrews degree.

Academic misconduct includes inter alia the presentation of material as one's own when it is not one's own; the presentation of material whose provenance is academically inappropriate; and academically inappropriate behaviour in an examination or class test. Any work that is submitted for feedback and evaluation (whether formative or summative, at any point in the programme of study) is liable to consideration under this Academic Misconduct policy. Please note that the above are not exhaustive, and other forms of academic misconduct not listed here will be treated as such by the University.

All work submitted by students is expected to represent good academic practice.

The University's policy covers the behaviour of both undergraduate and postgraduate students.

All students are advised to familiarise themselves with the University’s Guide to Academic misconduct or the relevant information in the Students' Association’s web site.
